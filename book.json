      "A large bunch of asparagus",

      "100g (4 oz.) freshly grated parmesan cheese*",
      "4 eggs",
      "Salt and pepper"
    ],
    "instructions": "Cook your trimmed asparagus in well-salted water, using one of the standard methods (see below) until just tender\u2014removing them from the heat slightly less tender than you like to eat them, as they will continue to cook as you proceed with the next steps. Let the asparagus stalks drain in a colander. (NB: Do not refresh with cold water; you want the asparagus to stay warm.)\nWhile the asparagus are draining, take a skillet big enough to hold all your eggs and melt the butter in it. Fry the eggs gently in the butter. Regulate the heat to make sure the butter does not darken or (God forbid!) burn. (Although unorthodox, I like to add just a bit of olive oil to the butter to help prevent this.) As they eggs cook, spoon the hot butter over the whites of the eggs to help cook them on top. Season to taste. The eggs are done when the whites are just set and the yolk still liquid.\nWhile the eggs are cooking (they will only take a minute or two) arrange the asparagus on a heated serving platter. The traditional pattern is to arrange the asparagus stalks in a 'star', with the tips all pointed towards the center of the platter, which should, of course, be round and large enough to accommodate this arrangement. Personally, I find this a bit fussy (and the asparagus tends to lose heat this way) so I simply line them up more or less neatly on an oval platter.\nThen sprinkle the grated cheese, which you should grate at the last moment to retain its full flavor, all over the asparagus. It should look like a heavy dusting of snow that covers the asparagus more or less entirely. Then place your eggs on top of the asparagus and spoon the melted butter remaining in the skillet all over. The eggs and hot butter should melt the cheese entirely.\nServe immediately, as this dish is at its best when it is still nice and warm.",

      "250g (1/2 lb.) salt cod, soaked for 24 hours and cleaned of any stray bones",

Add a small pinch of salt, a slice or two of lemon and a bay leaf. Continue to simmer for 20 minutes, until tender but not yet falling apart. When done, transfer the pieces of salt cod to a large bowl with a slotted spoon.\nStart to break up the salt cod pieces with a sturdy wooden spoon. When the fish has broken up into shreds, add the garlic (if using) and then start to drizzle the oil into the fish. Stir with the wooden spoon, incorporating the oil slowly into the fish as you stir, as if you were making mayonnaise. Continue like this until the fish has formed a nice, but not entirely smooth paste. There should still be small bits of fish here and there. If you find the paste a bit too thick, you can add a spoonful or two of the cooking water. Taste and adjust for seasoning\u2014you may not need any salt, but you probably will, as salt cod can be surprisingly bland after it has soaked. Mix in some chopped parsley.\nBaccal\u00e0 mantecato should be served at room temperature, typically on top of crostini di polenta as shown in the picture above. In Venice, polenta blanca or white polenta is the most authentic choice, but yellow polenta as shown will certainly do fine if you, like me, you don't have any of the white variety on hand. It can also be served with soft, hot polenta for a more substantial dish.",

      "One batch of your favorite pie crust, store bought if you like"

    "instructions": "Saut\u00e9 the onions (see Notes for the best onions to use) in a generous amount of olive oil over gentle heat, seasoning with a bit of salt and pepper and taking care not to let them brown too much. (At this stage of cooking, it helps to cover the saut\u00e9 pan. This speeds the reduction process and discourages burning. Add a spoonful or two of water if needed.) When the onions are translucent and well reduced in volume, add the chopped plum tomatoes and continue to cook until the tomatoes have totally melted into the onions and any liquid has evaporated. (Once the liquid has evaporated, you will hear the onions begin to 'sizzle'.) Turn off the heat and let the onion mixture cool completely.\nSpread the saut\u00e9ed onion mixture in a 23 cm/9-inch pie or quiche pan lined with a crust of your choice (see Notes for details on different crusts to use). Arrange some black olives and anchovy fillets, roughly chopped if you like, evenly on top of the onions. You should use enough so that every bite will have a bit of olive and a bit of anchovy. Cover the pie with another round of crust, pinch the bottom and top crusts together and then either trim off the edges (as in the photo above) or fold the extra bit of crust inwards to make a nice border. Make slits in the top crust to allow air to escape. (If you prefer, you can also simply prick some holes in the crust.)\nBake the calzone in a moderately hot oven (180\u00b0 C, 375\u00b0 F) for about 30-45 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned and the pie is giving off a wonderfully savory aroma. Allow the pie to cool before serving. You can eat it warm (not hot) but, to my taste, the pie is much better at room temperature\u2014and it tastes even better the day after you make it.",

    ],
    "instructions": "The first step in this recipe, which is not absolutely necessary but a good idea, especially for larger, more mature eggplant, is to remove the excess liquid from the eggplant by sprinking the eggplant cubes with salt and placing them in a colander, with a small plate on top to exert some gentle pressure and one below to catch the eggplant liquid as it drains. Let the eggplant steep for an hour or more.\nWhen you are ready to cook, gather up a handful of eggplant with a paper towel, give it a gentle squeeze to dry the cubes, and throw them into abundant olive oil\u2014about 1 cm (1/2 in) deep\u2014in a large pot. (Enameled cast iron pots work particularly well.) Work in batches to avoid crowding the eggplant, removing them with a skimmer when the eggplant cubes are just lightly browned to a basket or bowl lined with paper towels to soak up the excess oil.\nWhen all your eggplant is done, there should be less oil in the pan, but still enough to cook with. Add the celery, saut\u00e9 for a few minutes until the celery is tender but still has some 'bite' left in it. Season with salt and pepper as it cooks. Remove with a skimmer and set aside.\nNow add the onion to the remaining oil in the pot and saut\u00e9 it gently until it is quite soft. Add the tomato. Simmer the tomato until it has melted and reduced to a nice, sauce-like consistency.\nNow add back your eggplant and celery, along with the capers, olives and the marjoram. Allow everything to simmer together for about 5-10 minutes. A minute or two before it's done, add the sugar and vinegar, mix well (but gently!) and let it finish simmering.

To check for tenderness, pierce the artichoke at its thickest point with a paring knife. If you can remove the knife from the artichoke without picking it up, it should be done.\nNow, just before serving, comes the tricky part: dip you hang in lukewarm water and sprinkle it into the frying pan to provoke a splattering, covering the frying pan very quickly to prevent the oil from splattering all over the stovetop (and the cook!) When things have died down, you're done. The result is a lovely open \"flower\" whose taste is indescribable and whose texture is an amazing mixture of crispy and soft.",

Then, using a paring knife or spoon, dig out the 'choke' (the collection of fibers and inedible small leaves at the core of the vegetable) to create a cavity to hold the stuffing.\nUsing a spoon (or your hands!) stuff the center of the artichoke and the spaces between the leaves as well.\nPlace the stuffed artichokes on a baking dish.

Check for doneness with a knife; they should be tender but not 'mushy'.\nAllow the artichokes to cool before serving, moistened with a bit of the liquid.",

The slice should 'grow' to almost double their original size.\nLay the slices out on plates. (Although this is an appetizer, given the size of of slices, you'll need a dinner plate.)

    "instructions": "In a mixer, mix together the dough ingredients with the paddle. Then drizzle in enough water to make a wet dough, usually about 1/2 as much as the flour by volume. Switch from paddle to dough hook and knead the dough on the lowest speed for about 5 minutes. (If not using a standing mixer, see Notes.)\nScoop the wet dough out of the mixing bowl onto a well-floured surface. Using well-floured hands, form the dough into a smooth ball and place it into a greased bowl.\nCover the bowl with a towel and let the dough rise for at least two hours, until it doubles in size. (You can let it go longer if you like.)\nWhile the dough is rising, cut up your meats and cheeses into small cubes and mix everything up in a bowl. Set aside until needed.\nAfter the dough has risen, punch it down and scoop it out onto a well floured surface again. Take a handful and set aside for later use. Use your hands to flatten out the rest of the dough into a rectangular shape about 1 cm (1/4 inch) thick. (You can use a rolling pin if you like, but the dough is quite soft enough to just use your hands.)\nNow take the filling and spread it out evenly all over the top of the dough.\nGently roll the rectangle up, as tightly as you can manage, into a long torpedo-like shape, curling it around. Now take the dough and place it gently into a large ring mold, bring the ends around and pinching them together. Cover the mold with a towel and let the dough rise again for another two hours or so, until it has doubled again.\nNow nestle the eggs into the top of the dough ring at even intervals. Take the dough you have set aside and form it into ten thin strips. Use these strips to make crosses on top of the eggs.\nPreheat the oven to 180C/375F. When the oven is hot, place the mold into the oven and bake for about an hour, perhaps a bit more, until the top is nice and golden brown. (You can raise the temperature a bit, to 200C/400F, towards the end if you find it is not browning enough.\nTake the mold out of the oven, unmold your casatiello and let it cool on a baking rack. Serve it lukewarm or at room temperature.",

Drain the shrimp and run them under cold water to stop them cooking. Leave them to drain until you need them for the next step.\nPrepare the sauce by briskly whisking together all the sauce ingredients in a large mixing bowl. The sauce should be thick but just pourable. If too thick, add a few drops of cream to thin it out. Taste and adjust the seasonings, a bit more salt, or perhaps a dash more brandy or Worcestershire if it needs it.\nIf using larger shrimp, cut them into bite-sized pieces. Add the shrimp to the mixing bowl with the sauce, then gingerly fold the shrimp into the sauce with a spatula. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a good 30 minutes, or until you want to serve your shrimp cocktail.\nLay a lettuce leaf in individual serving bowls or dishes. Pile portions of the shrimp mixture on top of the lettuce. Then top with your choice of one or more of toppings if you like. Pictured here are salmon roe and chives, a particularly pretty and delicious combination.",

Shallow-fry the zucchini blossom in the olive oil until lightly brown on each side.\nDrain them on paper towels or on a baking rack as they are done.\nServe as soon as all the fritters are done, while they are still warm.",

Drain.\nPass the vegetables through a food mill, using the medium dish. Mix well and place the resulting pur\u00e9e in a non-stick skillet over gentle heat, stirring constantly, until any excess liquid has evaporated. You'll know it's done when the pur\u00e9e thickens so it comes away easily from the bottom of the pan. Transfer the pur\u00e9e to a mixing bowl and let it cool completely.\nAdd the rest of the filling ingredients to the bowl and mix until the mixture is smooth and homogeneous. The pur\u00e9e should be rather thick. If need be, mix in some more grated Parmesan to tighten it up. Taste and adjust for seasoning; the pur\u00e9e should be quite savory.\nNow for the slightly tricky part: Open each zucchini blossom and gingerly remove the pistil inside, taking care not to bruise the petals or opening them too much.\nFill the center of each zucchini blossom with some of the pur\u00e9e. This is best done with a pastry bag if you have one. If you don't, you can improvise by snipping off one corner of a ZipLock or other plastic bag. (In a pinch, you can spoon the filling into the blossom, but it's rather tedious and delicate work.) Fill them well, but leave some room at the tip.\nAs you fill each blossom, twist the end to close it up, then place them in a pre-oiled baking dish. Drizzle everything with olive oil.\nBake in a hot (200C/400F) oven for about 20-30 minutes, until the zucchini blossoms are heated through and have browned on top.\nServe warm or at room temperature.",

Make sure that the oil is just hot enough so that it gently bubbles around the pieces as you place them into the pan. If the oil is not hot enough, the vegetables will turn out greasy; too hot and the egg batter will brown before the insides of the vegetable pieces are fully cooked. You'll need to fry a few pieces at a time, as many as will fit comfortably in your frying pan without crowding. (If you crowd them, they will steam, and get soggy and greasy.)\nYou then drain the vegetables, either on a plate lined with paper towels or\u2014my preferred method\u2014on a cooling rack placed over a baking sheet to catch the oil and stray bits of batter. Keep your already fried vegetables warm in the oven while you are frying the rest.\nSprinkle the fried vegetables with salt and serve either hot or at room temperature, with lemon wedges if you like.

Slice the carrots into rounds, not too thinly. Slice the celery across the grain. Trim the spring onions aof their roots and most of their green tops, then if large, slice them vertically in 2 or even 4. If using pearl onions, peel them and leave them whole. If they're fresh, they should be very easy to peel, otherwise you can blanch them for a minute or two to loosen their skins. Trim the green beans but otherwise leave them whole. Slice the bell peppers into strips or bite-sized squares, as you prefer. (See our post on trimming and slicing peppers for details.) You should slice the cucumbers, like the carrots, into fairly thick rounds or, if they are big, into bite-sized cubes. You can then lay out your veggies on a cutting board.\nBring all the ingredients for the poaching/preserving liquid to a simmer.\nAdd the vegetables in the order listed, beginning with the cauliflower, carrots and, if using, pearl onions. Let them simmer for 3 or 4 minutes, then add the green beans, spring onions, celery, peppers and cucumbers, in that order. Let each come to a simmer before adding the next. Simmer everything together for another 3 or 4 minutes, until the vegetables are crisp-tender.\nWith a skimmer, transfer the vegetables to a colander to drain, then on to a large baking sheet or other flat surface to cool, reserving their poaching liquid. Let that cool completely as well.\nIn the meanwhile, sterilize the mason jars by steeping them in boiling water for 1o minutes. Carefully remove them from the water and let them dry. In the alternative, if your dishwasher has a sanitizing cycle, wash them using that cycle.\nFill the mason jars with the vegetables, leaving a bit of room at the top. Pack them in, but not too tightly. Fill the jars with enough poaching liquid to cover all the vegetables.\nClose up the mason jars. Although quite edible as soon as you're done, it's best to let the giardiniera mellow in the fridge for at least a day or two before eating.",

    "instructions": "Take the slices of bread, then place a slice of mozzarella cheese between two of the bread slices to make a sandwich. (Make sure that the mozzarella slices are smaller than the bread slices, so that you have a good 1/2in/1 cm margin around the slices, to prevent the cheese from oozing out as it melts during cooking.)\nFill a large skillet with the oil, enough for a semi-deep fry, about 2cm/1 inch deep. While the oil is heating up, set up your 'assembly line': Line up the milk, flour and seasoned beaten egg, each in separate bowls, preferably right next to the frying pan. Have a grate at the ready for draining the sandwiches after they're fried. Here was my set up:\nMis en place\nDip each mozzarella sandwich, on both sides, in the milk until nice and moist, then in the flour, then in the beaten eggs seasoned with salt and pepper, making sure the bread is well impregnated with the egg. Then fry each sandwich in the oil over moderately high heat until golden brown on each side\u2014a few at a time so that you don't crowd the frying pan. As the sandwiches are done, transfer them to the rack while you fry the rest.\nWhen they're all done, sprinkle the sandwiches with salt and serve immediately.\nMozzarella in carrozza is traditionally served just like this, perhaps with lemon wedges on the side. But I like to gild the lily by serving them with a bit of anchovy sauce: you empty a tin or jar of anchovies with some olive oil in a saucepan over moderate heat. Stir until the anchovies have broken up and are sizzling, then add a tablespoon or so of water. The anchovies will almost instantly form a smooth sauce. Add finely minced garlic (a garlic press works well here) and parsley. Stir once, then remove from the heat. You can spoon this sauce on top or around the sandwiches or, since anchovies can be 'controversial', in a sauceboat for those who want it.",

      "500g (1 lb) mild green olives, pitted or unpitted (see Notes)",

      "Salt and pepper",
      "6-8 eggs, beaten",
      "Flour",
      "Breadcrumbs"
    ],
    "instructions": "Step 1: Make the stuffing: In a large skillet, gently saut\u00e9 the onion, carrot and celery, along with the pancetta if using, in olive oil until the onion is soft and translucent, seasoning with salt and pepper as you go. Add the ground meats and break them up and mix them with the soffritto. Saut\u00e9 until the meats have lost their raw color, then add a splash of white wine and simmer gently until the wine has evaporated, about 10 minutes or so. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the mixture cool completely.\nTransfer the mixture to a food processor and process until you have a smooth paste. Transfer the paste to a mixing bowl and add the grated cheese, breadcrumbs, egg, and spices. Turn everything together with a spatula or wooden spoon until you have a uniform mixture which is soft but compact. If it's bit too loose or too moist, add more breadcrumbs or grated cheese to the mixture. Place the mixture in the fridge and let it rest there for at least 30 minutes.\nStep 2: Stuff the olives: Remove the mixture from the fridge and stuff your olives:\nIf using pitted olives, split them down the middle vertically, leaving a bit at the bottom connected. Open the olive like a book and insert a small amount of the stuffing mixture, then press the two sides back together to re-form the olive.\nIf using unpitted olives, you'll need to pit them. You could use an olive pitter, but the traditional method is to use a small paring knife to cut the flesh away from the pit in a spiral motion. Of course, your olive will not retain its shape. Rather, you'll wind up with a spiral strip of olive. You then take a small ball of stuffing and wrap the olive strip around it, \"reconstructing\" the olive, as it were, slightly larger than it was before.\nStep 3: Bread the olives: Set up three bowls with the flour, egg and breadcrumbs. Now, as if you were making breaded cutlets, flour each stuffed olive lightly, shaking off the excess, then dip it in the egg and finally roll it in the breadcrumbs. Roll the breaded olive between the palms of your hands to give it a nice round shape. As you go, set the olives out to dry a bit. Although not absolutely necessary, it is a good idea to repeat the process for a uniform and crispy crust; since olives have a rather smooth, round surface, the breading (for me at least) tends to be uneven on the first go.\nStep 4: Fry the olives: Once all the olives are breaded, fry them in abundant olive oil until they are golden brown, turning them frequently so they cook evenly. Drain on paper towels or a baking rack.\nOlive ascolane can be served warm or room temperature, as you prefer. But unlike most fried foods, I would not eat them straight from the fryer, unless you enjoy a scalded tongue!",

Make sure the balls are well spaced, as they tend to stick together, especially when they first start cooking, as they cheese starts to melt and before the egg binding takes hold.\nTransfer the fried balls to the tomato sauce and let them simmer there for a good 15-20 minutes.

    "instructions": "Prepare the eggplant. Cut the eggplants into fairly thin slices. Now you should 'purge' them of their excess liquid, which can be bitter. Sprinkle the eggplant slices with salt, and then lay them in a colander laid on top of a plate. Cover the slices with a small plate on which you should place something a bit heavy like a can of beans or tomatoes. This will help press the liquid out of the eggplant. Leave them for about an hour. You should notice a small puddle of brownish water below the colander, which you should discard, of course. Remove the slices from the colander and pat them dry.\nFry the eggplant. Dip the eggplant slices in flour, followed by an egg and cheese 'bath' made from beaten eggs, grated pecorino cheese, finely chopped parsley, salt and pepper. Shallow fry the eggplant slices over moderate heat until they are golden brown on the outside and tender inside.\nYou will need to fry the eggplant slices in batches. As each batch is done, drain and set on paper towels to absorb the excess oil as you continue with the next batch. Repeat until you're done.\nPrepare the tomato sauce. In the meanwhile, prepare a very light tomato sauce by combining chopped tomatoes (fresh if in season, but canned tomatoes are fine), a few leaves of fresh basil, salt, chopped garlic and just a few drops of olive oil. Simmer for about 15 minutes, until the tomatoes have melted into a sauce If using canned tomatoes, add a bit of water to loosen the sauce before simmering.\nPrepare the cheeses. Take a large mozzarella, preferably fresh, and slice it. Grate lots of parmesan cheese, at least a cupful (you can grate it as you assemble the dish).\nAssemble the dish. You are now ready to assemble the dish. In a bake-and-serve pan, place a layer of the fried eggplant slices, then a bit of the tomato sauce, then a few mozzarella slices, a bit of shredded basil (optional) and grated parmesan cheese. Season. Then add another layer of eggplant and continue until you've used up your ingredients. End with tomato sauce and parmesan. (Don't put mozzarella on top, it will brown too quickly in the oven and burn.)\nBaking. Bake in a hot oven (400 F, 200 C) for about 30 minutes, or until the dish is bubbling hot and the top a bit brown. Let the dish cool a bit before eating, at least 15 minutes. In fact, it tastes best made ahead and reheated (just a bit) before eating. It can also be eaten at room temperature.",

      "Salt and pepper",
      "1 egg, plus a few drops of water (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": "Making the pasta sfoglia: Place the flour and the lard in a large bowl. Mix them together with your hands, squeezing the lard through your fingers until it is well incorporated into the flour, forming little grains that will look a bit like moist sand.\nNow begin to add the water, mixing this time with a spatula, until the flour has come together. Use your hands to form the dough into a ball. Wrap the dough ball with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge to chill for about an hour.\nMaking the filling: Put the ricotta and eggs into another large bowl. Mix them well until you have achieved a smooth custard-like mixture. Now add the other cheeses and cured meats, mixing them into the ricotta and egg mixture with a spatula until the mixture is homogeneous. The mixture will have stiffened up quite a bit. If you're still waiting for the dough to chill, place the filling in the fridge too, covered with plastic wrap to keep it moist. (Both dough and filling can wait for several hours, or even overnight, if you like.)\nAssembling the pizza rustica: When the dough ball is well chilled, take it from the fridge and unwrap it. Flour your working surface (if possible, it should be marble or granite) and your dough ball, too, to prevent sticking. Take about 2/3 of the dough, flour it well on all sides and form it again into a ball, and flatten the dough ball out a bit with a rolling pin. Now take the rolling pin and roll out the dough into a fairly thin (but not paper thin) disk, turning the dough with each roll to ensure it comes out as evenly round as you can manage. (No need for perfection here...)\nNow you need to place the dough into a pie plate\u2014but whatever you do, don't try to move this delicate dough with your hands! Instead, roll up the dough with your rolling pin. Then, using your rolling pin, transfer the dough onto a pie plate and unfurl it on top of the plate, making sure it covers the entire plate by a good measure. Press the dough down into the plate to make a shell. Cut off the excess dough that hangs over the edges of the plate. Place all the stuffing into the shell.\nNow you have two choices: you can roll out the remaining dough into another disk, to use as a cover for the pie OR, as I like, you can take a little more time and effort to make a lattice top. For the latter, roll the remaining dough out into a long, rectangular shape, then using a pastry wheel, cut the dough into long strips. If you're hand isn't too steady (like mine) you can use the rolling pin as a guide:\nNow lay the strips over the filling in a cross-hatch pattern. Take up all the remaining dough and roll it out into one long strip. Twist that last strip so it resembles a cord and use it to create a trim all around the edge of the pice plate.\nFinally, if you like, take one more egg, add a few drops of water and beat them together well with a fork. Then brush this egg wash all over the surface of the pie. This will help the surface to brown and develop an attractive sheen.\nBaking: Place the pizza rustica into a moderately hot over, say about 190C/375F for an hour or so, until the filling is cooked through and the top is nicely brown. If you like a browner crust, you can raise the temperature for the last 15 minutes or so, using the convection setting if you have one.\nLet the pie cool for 20-30 minutes before eating. The pie can also be eaten at room temperature which, to my taste, makes it even better.",

When cool, squeeze as much of their liquid out of them as you can out and mince well.\nAdd the minced celery to a large mixing bowl and add the eggs, grated cheese, salt and a good grind of pepper. Mix everything well, then mix in the breadcrumbs, as much as you need to bind everything together into a kind of 'dough'. Let this rest for about 15-20 minutes.\nForm the celery mixture into balls about the size of walnuts. A small ice cream scoop makes short work of this task. When you're done, roll the celery balls in more breadcrumbs so they are well coated.\nShallow fry the celery balls into moderate hot oil until they are golden brown all over, making sure they're well spaced. Proceed in batches if need be. As you go, set the fried celery balls on paper towels or a baking rack to drain of their excess oil.\nServe your polpette di sedano while they're still warm, if you like on a bed of tomato sauce, or at room temperature if you're enjoying them as finger food.",

Take off the heat and let cool completely.\nFollow the usual technique (see this post for details) with the listed ingredients, using 3 Tbs of flour instead of the usual 2 Tbs. Let this cool as well.\nMix the saut\u00e9ed green beans with the b\u00e9chamel, along with the grated Parmesan cheese, egg yolks and and, if using, the optional diced cheese. Season again with salt and pepper. (Go light on the salt as green beans should already be seasoned and the cheese will add savor as well.)\nPour the batter into individual ramekins that you've greased well with oil or butter, leaving some space as the batter will swell considerably during baking. Place the ramekins in a baking dish or tray and bake in a moderate (180C/350F) oven for about 30 minutes or so, until the batter is cooked through and the tops are lightly browned.\nRemove the ramekins from the baking dish and let them cool, at least for a good 15-20 minutes.

      "4 eggs",
      "100g (3-1/2 oz) of grated Parmesan cheese",
      "Salt and pepper"
    ],
    "instructions": "Begin by boiling, or even better, steaming fennel bulbs, trimmed of their stalks and cut into halves or quarters, according to their size. When they are tender\u2014a knife should slide easily in and out of them\u2014drain them well. Let them cool a bit and, when they are cool enough to handle, either cut them into small dice or pur\u00e9e them, as you prefer. (I also like to add some of the fronds from the stalks for extra flavor.) A food processor works well for the purpose. Then melt a good amount of butter in a skillet and add your fennel, allowing it to absorb the flavor of the butter and to evaporate any residual liquid.\nNow make some b\u00e9chamel in a separate saucepan, in the usual way (see this post), using 2 cups of milk. Add the b\u00e9chamel to the saut\u00e9ed fennel, and season to taste with salt, pepper and a handful of grated parmesan cheese. Allow the mixture to cool off and then add the eggs. Mix everything up well and pour into a well-greased loaf pan or other mold (see Notes below). Place your mold into a larger baking pan and pour water around the sides, to make what the Italians call a bagnomaria or 'bain-marie' in French and English:\nSformato in Bain Marie\nPlace the baking dish into a moderately slow oven (about 325F, 170C) and bake until the mixture has fully set. To test doneness, insert a paring knife or skewer inserted into the mold; it should come out completely clean. Baking time varies according to the size and shape of your mold, but for the loaf pan shown in the picture, it took about an hour. Individual molds will, of course, take much less time, as little as 15-20 minutes.\nLet the sformato cool for about 15 minutes or so. Loosen it from its mold by running a knife along the edges of the pan. Then unmold itonto a serving platter. This can be done by placing the platter over the loaf pan or other mold, then holding pan and platter together with both hands, flipping it over. Gently remove the pan, revealing your sformato in all its glory. Serve warm or at room temperature.",

The exact time will depend on the size and shape of your loaf pan. To test for doneness, shake the pan a bit; it should not wiggle. You can also pierce the top of the loaf with a skewer or knife; if it's done, it will come out clean. (No worries about ruining the looks of your sformato, since the top will soon become the bottom and won't show.)\nRemove the loaf pan from its bath and let the sformato cool for at least 15 minutes. (More if you like; in fact, to my mind it is even better when it cools completely.)\nPlace the loaf pan on a cutting board (or, if you want to serve it whole, on a serving platter) and, holding them together tightly with both hands, turn pan and board over. Shake the pan a bit and, with any luck, the sformato will come loose. Remove the pan et voil\u00e0, you have your sformato! Cut the loaf into slices and serve, either on a platter or in individual dishes, either by itself (as pictured) or with a bit of tomato sauce.",

    "instructions": "Dissolve the yeast in the warm water and add to the flour along with the rest of the ingredients for the crust. Knead until you have a uniform, smooth ball of dough. Set inside a large bowl, cover well and let sit for an hour or more.\nMeanwhile, take the leeks, trim off their bottoms (and any roots) and cut off their dark green tops. Remove any tough or dried out outer leaves. Split each leek in half and check to see if there is any grit between the leaves. If you see any grit at all, wash the leeks well in several changes of water.\nCut the leeks crosswise into thin strips. Let the cut up leeks simmer, covered, in abundant olive oil and a pinch of salt, until they are soft and much reduced. Uncover the pot and stir the leeks from time to time; if you notice them coloring at all, add a tad of water to keep them from browning. When the leeks are done, transfer them to a large bowl and let them cool completely. Mix in the eggs and season with a bit more salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper. (Bugialli advises that the filling should be very peppery.)\nAfter the dough has rested, lay it on a well-floured surface, flatten it with a few bangs of your rolling pin, then roll it out into a thin disk.\nLay the dough in a well greased springform mold about 24 cm/10 in across, letting any excess ends hang over the sides.\nSprinkle the pancetta over the bottom of the mold, then pour over the leek and egg mixture, using a spatula to spread it evenly on top of the pancetta. Now, fold the ends of the dough back over the filling.\nBake the mold in a hot (200C/400F) oven for about 45 minutes, until the filling is complete cooked through and the crust nice and brown.\nLet the torta cool in its mold for at least 15-20 minute before unfolding and serving. It can also be served at room temperature, and to my mind it's even better that way.",

    "instructions": "To hard boil the eggs: Put the eggs in a saucepan with enough water to cover them by a good 3 cm/1 inch or more and (if you like) a dash of vinegar. Bring the eggs to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. Let the eggs simmer for a minute or so. Turn off the heat and cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. Let the eggs rest, covered, for 10 minutes or so (for medium eggs), 15 minutes for large or extra large eggs. You can let them rest for a few minutes longer if you want very firm eggs; personally, I like my yolks to have just a smidgen of runniness at the center.\nWhen the eggs are done, drain them into a colander and run them immediately under cold water. Let them cool a bit before peeling them under running cold water. Made this way, they should peel quite easily, just crack them gently against the side of the sink and rub the shell off with your fingers as the running water carries the shell away.\nMeanwhile, you can make your salsa verde: Place all the ingredients, minus the olive oil, in a food processor. Using the pulse function, chop them all into a fine mince. Then turn on the processor and pour in the olive oil, until you have reached a nice, 'saucy' consistency. The sauce should be thick but loose enough to be pourable. Taste for seasoning. The sauce should be very piquant; add more salt or pepper or other seasonings as suits your taste.\nCut the hard-boiled eggs in half using a wet slicing knife. Arrange on a plate and drizzle the green sauce over and around them. If you have some left over, you can serve it separately at table\u2014it's so delicious that guests often want more on their eggs.",

    ],
    "instructions": "You begin with the meat. Classically speaking, this is a veal roast (see Notes below for the common cuts). But you can economize by using pork loin or\u2014my favorite\u2014pork tenderloin or turkey breast instead. Whichever you choose, prepare a kind of court bouillon by simmering the onion, carrot, celery, bay leaf, cloves, salt and whole peppercorns in a mixture of white wine and water, about a glassful of wine and just enough water so that the liquid will entirely cover the meat when it is placed in the pot. (To be sure, you can place the meat in the cold liquid beforehand to see if there is enough liquid.)\nAfter the aromatics and liquids have simmered for about 10-15 minutes, add the meat, raising the heat if need be to keep the water simmering nicely but it should not boil, which would toughen the meat. I cover the pot partially to reduce evaporation. Simmering time will depend on the meat you use, but the classic recipes call for cooking the veal roast around 60-90 minutes, depending on the size and the cut. (The original cuts were suitable for long simmering, modern recipes often call for loin, which should be just cooked through.) Pork loin should take about 60 minutes or less, while the tenderloin, which is quite a 'skinny' piece of meat, should take no more than 20-30 minutes. Turkey breast should take about the same as pork tenderloin.\nRemove the pot from the heat and allow the meat to cool completely, still immersed in its cooking liquid. This should take about an hour or so, and it results in a moister and more flavorful meat. But if you are in a hurry, you can remove the meat from the liquid and place it in the fridge to cool down quickly.\nWhile the meat is cooling, it is time to turn to the sauce. You begin by making a mayonnaise in a blender: place the two whole eggs (not just the yolks) in a blender with the juice of half a lemon and pinch of salt.\nThen turn on the blender to 'pur\u00e9e' and let it go for just a few seconds. The egg mixture will have turned frothy:\nNow turn the blender on again and, with the little clear plastic 'window' in the lid removed, starting pouring in olive oil little in a slow but steady stream, until the eggs and oil emulsify and you get a nice, thick and creamy mayonnaise. I believe that the classic proportions call for one cup of oil per egg, but I usually 'eyeball' it and stop when the mayo is nice and thick.\nBy the way, this is one case where so called 'light' olive oil may be better than the dark green fruity kind, which would give the sauce a too strong olivey taste. Or you can use Proven\u00e7ale olive oil, which is more delicate.In any event, once your mayo is ready, add a fillet or two of anchovy, a spoonful of capers and a can of tunafish (preferably packed in olive oil). Blend again until smooth.\nThen temper the sauce with a couple of spoonfuls of the meat cooking liquid, enough to produce a pourable but still quite quick sauce. Transfer to a bowl.When the meat has achieved room temperature, remove it from its broth, pat it dry and place it on a cutting board. Slice it against the grain into thin slices.\nNow take each slice (you'll probably need to do this by hand, otherwise use tongs) and dip in on each side in the tuna sauce and arrange the slices on a platter, each slice just slightly overlapping like so many roof tiles, in an attractive pattern. While pork tenderloin, there will be room for several rows of meat.\nOther cuts are larger, so you will probably need to make a single row or arrange them in a circular pattern on a large platter.Finally, finish the dish off by pouring over the top the remaining sauce. While you can serve the dish right away, it develops better flavor if you let it sit for several hours, overnight or\u2014in some recipes\u2014for a few days, so the flavor of the tuna sauce penetrates the meat completely. Before you are ready to serve, garnish the dish with capers and, if you like a more elegant presentation, some thin slices of lemon around the edges and some parsley leaves.",

NB: Use tongs and handle your clams gingerly, keeping them perfectly horizontal if you can to avoid losing their tasty brine.\nYou can serve your clams as is, or with a drizzle of oil and/or a squeeze of lemon juice. But for even more flavor, try napping some freshly made salmoriglio sauce onto each clam. as pictured above. It complements the taste of the clams perfectly, and as when the leftover sauce mixes with the juices on the bottom of the dish, it makes for exquisite dipping with a crusty piece of homemade bread!",

    "instructions": "Cut both ends off the zucchini, then split them in half lengthwise. Using a small measuring spoon or teaspoon, carve out a hollow in each zucchini half so they look like little 'canoes'. (In Italian they call the barchette or 'little boats', but to me canoe is more like it.) Chop the pulp and reserve.\nPlace the zucchini canoes in a steamer, sprinkle with salt, and steam them until they are crisp-tender.\nWhile the zucchini are steaming, saut\u00e9 the onion in olive oil until soft and translucent. Add the reserved zucchini pulp and a pinch of salt and pepper. Let the zucchini pulp cook for a few minutes to absorb the flavors of the oil and onion and lose its excess liquid. Allow this mixture to cool.\nMix the zucchini mixture with the rest of the stuffing ingredients in a large bowl until you have a homogenous mixture. Taste the mixture and adjust for seasoning; it should be very tasty. When the zucchini are done, remove them from the steamer and let them cool upside so they can drain, on a rack or kitchen towel.\nWhen the zucchini are cool, stuff their cavities and lay them out snugly in a baking dish. Pour over a glassful of water or white wine (mixed with the tomato paste, if using). Drizzle with olive oil. (You can make the recipe ahead up to this point.)\nBake the zucchini in a hot oven (200\u00b0C/400\u00b0F) for about 20 minutes or so, until the stuffing is cooked through and the tops nicely browned. (You can test doneness with a paring knife or skewer, if the stuffing has a firm texture and the knife or skewer comes out clean, it's done.) Let the zucchini cool, at least a bit, before serving. They are fine warm or at room temperature, but not scalding hot.",

The traditional, and still the best, way to dry the zucchini is by laying them out in the sun, on a drying rack or simply on a cutting board, for an hour or two (depending on the strength of the sun) to dry, turning them halfway through. They should not dry out totally, of course, but be dry and slightly 'rubbery' to the touch. If it's a cloudy day or this method is otherwise impractical for you, then you can use the more familiar method of sprinkling the zucchini rounds in salt and draining them, weighted down, in a colander. After an hour, pat them dry and proceed with the next step.\nOnce dry, shallow-fry the zucchini in olive oil, to which you will have added a clove or two of garlic. The zucchini rounds should fit loosely in one layer, so you will probably need to proceed in batches. Allow the rounds to brown a bit on one side, until nicely spottled but not uniformly brown (see photo) and then transfer them to a shallow bowl while you fry the next batch.\nYou sprinkle each layer of fried zucchini with salt (go easy if you've salted them as a first step), pepper, roughly torn or chopped mint leaves and some white wine vinegar.\nContinue frying, layering and seasoning the zucchini rounds until you have used them all up. Allow the zucchini to marinate for at least an hour. The flavor improves with time, and it is even better the next day.",

    "ingredients": [
      "1 egg",
      "100g (1 cup) flour",
      "A pinch of salt",
      "A drop of olive oil (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": "Using a standing mixer: Pour the flour into the mixing bowl with a pinch of salt and the egg(s). To make the rolling and cutting easier later on, you can add a drop of oil, before adding the eggs although purists frown on this. Attach the dough paddle.\nTurn on the mixer mix at slow speed (setting 1 or 2) until the the eggs are well incorporated. The dough may look rather crumbly at this point, but not to worry.\nSwitch to the dough hook and continue to mix, first continuing at a slow speed, then turning it up a notch to a moderate speed (setting 3 or 4) until the dough sticks to the hook and\u2014hopefully\u2014forms a smooth surfaced, uniform ball. But depending on various factors, including the exact size of the eggs and the ambient humidity in your kitchen, one of two things may happen: either the ball will be very sticky and wet, in which case you can add a bit more flour until the dough becomes firmer, or the dough will remain too dry to form a ball, in which case you can add a bit of water.\nNB: You can use more or less the same method for making pasta dough in a normal food processor: Add you ingredients to the processor bowl and pulse until they form a ball, making adjustments if need be as described above.\nYou can also form the dough the old-fashioned way, entirely by hand: pour the flour in a mound on a spianatoia or other dry surface, then make a well in the middle of the flour (this is called a fontana, or fountain, in Italian). Add your eggs, salt and oil into this fountain. With a fork, begin to whisk the ingredients in the well, incorporating the flour at the sides of the well little by little. As the mixture becomes too dense to mix with your fork, begin to use your hands to incorporate more and more of the flour until you have a ball of dough.\nPlace the dough on a dry surface and knead it by hand for a few minutes until the dough has reached the right consistency, smooth and pliable and yet still firm. (If you find that the dough is too wet, sprinkle it with flour and knead the additional flour into the dough.\nThen allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes wrapped in plastic wrap or a plastic bag. This rest will 'relax' the dough and make it much easier to work with, but if you lack time, it is not an absolutely necessary step.\nThen put the pasta roller attachment on the mixer or a pasta 'machine', set at the widest setting and, taking a piece of dough corresponding to one of the eggs used to make the dough (in other words, if you used 3 eggs, cut the dough into three pieces), flatten it out with your hand or a rolling pin and then pass it through the roller, which will turn the dough ball into a rather thick sheet.\nIf the pasta has a smooth consistency (which is should if it has been properly kneaded and rested) then lightly flour the pasta sheet, turn the roller to the next, slightly narrower setting. (If not, fold the pasta sheet and pass it through the widest setting once again, and repeat as needed.) Keep passing the pasta sheet through successively narrower settings, one by one, until you reach the thickness you want, which will depend on the kind of pasta you are making. Repeat the process with the other pieces of dough, which you will have kept wrapped in plastic so they don't dry out.\nFor most kinds of pasta, such as tagliatelle, taglierini or fresh spaghetti, lay out the pasta sheet to dry on a towel or (my preferred method) on a baking rack. The rack will allow air to flow on both sides of the pasta, so it will dry more quickly and evenly. In either case, however, it is a good idea to turn the sheets over every once and while so they dry evenly; the top will always dry more quickly than the bottom, even when using the rack. The pasta is dry enough when it feels 'leathery' to the touch but not brittle. If it is not dry enough, the pasta stands will tend to stick together when you cut the sheet, while the dough will become unworkable if dries out. (If you notice that splits are beginning to open on the sides of the pasta sheets, then it is getting too dry, but if you act quickly enough, the dough can still be used.) With some practice (and a few inevitable misfires) recognizing the right degree of dryness will become second-nature.",

      "1 sprig of fresh rosemary",
      "Salt and pepper",
      "1 batch of freshly made egg pasta (see recipe), rolled out into thin sheets"
    ],
    "instructions": "To make the stuffing, cut the pork into smallish cubes and mix with a finely minced battuto of the garlic and rosemary, a generous salt and pepper. Let the pork marinate for at least a couple of hours.\nSaut\u00e9 the pork in butter over gentle heat. When the pork is cooked through, transfer it to a food processor, leaving the butter and bits of garlic and rosemary behind.\nAdd the mortadella and prosciutto to the food processor and process using the pulse function until you have a finely minced and fairly homogenous mixture. Add egg, grated cheese and nutmeg, then let it process until you have a very fine paste. The mixture should be quite dense and almost complete dry. If it is either a bit loose or a bit wet, add more cheese or some breadcrumbs. Taste for seasoning; the mixture should be very savory\u2014if not, add more salt.\nThe stuffing is now done. Set it aside in a bowl and refrigerate until you are ready to stuff your tortellini. (A spell in the fridge, besides avoiding spoilage, helps firm up the mixture, which makes it easier to work with as well.)\nNow make a batch of fresh egg pasta, following the master recipe. You want to roll out the pasta into thin sheets. (NB: On my KitchenAid pasta attachment, I find that ending with the 5 setting works well.)\nCut the pasta into squares and add the stuffing. Take a sheet of pasta and lay it out on a clean, flat, lightly floured surface. Cut the sheet into small squares, about 3-4cm (1 to 1-1/2 inches) wide.\nNow take your stuffing and place a small dot of it in the middle of each square. Some recipes will say to use a 1/4 teaspoon per, but for me a measurement like that is practically meaningless and, in any event, if you actually try to measure each bit of stuffing, you'll be at it all day. When in doubt, use less than you think you need.\nForm each tortellino by folding each square into triangles, taking one end and pulling it over the stuffing to touch the other end. Don't try to line up the points exactly. They should be ever so slightly askew to give the tortellino its classic look. Now take the two points at the 'base' of the triangle and twirl them around your index finger, attaching them on the other side of your finger to form a kind of ring. As you form each tortellino, place it on a dry towel, preferably one that has been draped over a baking rack, which allows for even air-flow above and below.\nCooking. Boil the tortellini in well-salted water (or, even better, in broth) until done. You don't want them al dente in the manner of pasta secca. They should be tender without being mushy, either. The time it takes will vary wildly according to how long they have been drying, but in no event should it take longer than a few minutes.\nServe immediately either in broth or with a sauce.",

At the last, raise the heat and allow the onions to caramelize until they are nice golden brown color\u2014but be sure not to burn them.\nRemove the beef for another use, possibly as a second course. The remaining onion cream is your sauce. Use the onion sauce to dress ziti or other stubby pastas. If you like, serve with grated parmesan or pecorino cheese. (I prefer the former over the latter.)",

Yes, you read that right: lard. You can use olive oil if you like, but for the real taste of rag\u00f9, lard is a must. (And there is no better fat for browning, by the way.) Brown as many pieces at a time as will fit in your pot in a single, well-spaced layer. (If you crowd the pieces of meat, they will steam and not brown.) Do not rush the process; take your time and brown them gently, so they render their fat and don't darken too much. Remove the pieces to a bowl or dish as they brown, replacing them with other pieces.\nWhen all the pieces of meat are brown, remove any remaining in the pot and add a generous amount of chopped onion and allow it to sweat until it is quite soft. Then add a clove or two of chopped garlic and, when you can just begin to smell their aroma, add back the browned meat. Turn the meat with the onion and garlic and simmer them together gently to allow the meat to insaporire (absorb the flavor of the aromatics), seasoning with salt and pepper as you turn.

If you don't have red wine, not to worry; Angelina actually didn't add wine to her rag\u00f9, but many recipes call for it, and it does add a nice additional layer of flavor.)\nThen add the best quality canned tomatoes that you can find (see Notes below), passing them through a food mill into the pot, enough to cover the meats entirely. (Some recipes call for tomato paste, but I find this makes the sauce too heavy.) Nestle a sprig or two of fresh parsley among the meats. Lower the heat, partially cover the pot, and let the sauce to simmer very slowly for at least 2-3 hours, until the sauce is thick and dark and very flavorful. Along the way, add your meatballs, which you will have fried separately in oil, and, if using, your pig's foot or rolled pig's skin.",

Cover immediately (depending on the heat, the wine may cause the oil to spatter) and cook over a lively flame until all of the clams have opened. Remove the clams and remove the meat from their shells. (If you like, you can leave a few clams in their shells for decorating your final dish.) If your clams are large, cut them up roughly. Keep the juices in the pot for later.\nMeanwhile, make a soffritto of finely chopped parsley and another clove or two of garlic gently saut\u00e9ed in a generous amount of olive oil. Add the canned tomatoes and simmer for a few minutes to let the flavors meld.\nAdd the fish stock or water to the tomato sauce, along with your fregola and the juices from the clams. Raise the heat until you have reached a low boil. It will seem as first as if you have way too much liquid, but not to worry: fregola absorbs a lot of liquid. You will soon see that the fregola will have absorbed most, if not all, of the liquid. In fact, you will probably need to add water from time to time; the fregola should be covered with liquid until it is almost done; then let it cook down to your taste (see Notes). Cooking time will vary, but count on 20 minutes or more.\nWhen the fregola are al dente, add the shelled clams to the pot, just long enough to heat them through. Ladle the fregola and accompanying sauce into deep pasta plates, top with reserved clams in their shells, a bit of finely chopped parsley and un filo d'olio (a drizzle of olive oil). Some freshly ground pepper would not be amiss, either.",

      "Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, q.b.",
      "Butter, q.b."
    ],
    "instructions": "Step 1: Make the rag\u00f9: This is the real 'heart' of the dish that gives the dish its savor. Since it takes several hours to make, and benefits from an overnight 'rest', better to make your rag\u00f9 the day before. The recipe is set out in this post.\nStep 2: Make the pasta: Make fresh egg pasta dough and roll it out into thin sheets following the master recipe. Then cut the sheets into lengths about as long (or wide) as the baking dish in which you plan to bake your lasagne. Take care, as the pasta will expand when it is cooked, so cut them just a bit shorter than the actual length or breadth of the pan. Since the pasta is not cut into strips as for fettuccine or taglierini, you need not dry the pasta if you're ready to make the lasagne right away. (NB: The true 'doc' version of lasagne alla bolognese is made with spinach pasta. Will post on this one of these days.)\nStep 3: Make the b\u00e9chamel: Prepare the b\u00e9chamel sauce, once again using the master recipe. (NB: You may not need this much b\u00e9chamel, but better to have too much than too little. There are lots of uses for leftovers.)\nStep 4: Cook the pasta and assemble the dish: Take your pasta sheets and simmer them, only one or two at a time, in well-salted water for just a minute or two, depending on just how thinly you've rolled out your pasta, and how long the pasta has been drying.\nAs each pasta sheet is done, fish it out of the water with a slotted spoon (the larger the better) and place it on a towel. With another towel, pat it dry. Then place the pasta sheets at the bottom of a greased baking dish, covering the entire bottom of the dish. It's OK to overlap the sheets a bit, but if there's too much overlap or the sheets are too big for the dish, you can always trim the cooked sheets to size.\nThen add a thin layer of b\u00e9chamel over the pasta, making sure to cover the entire surface of the pasta with a spatula. Lay over some of the rag\u00f9, then a generous dusting of grated parmesan cheese. (NB: Since all the components\u2014pasta, ragu and b\u00e9chamel\u2014should be well seasoned, there should normally be no reason to season the dish as you assemble it.)\nRepeat until you have run out of ingredients, or the baking dish is nearly full, or you've reached about four layers, ending with a layer of b\u00e9chamel, sprinkled with parmesan cheese and dotted with butter. (More than that and the lasagne will not cook properly.)\nStep 5: Baking the lasagne: Bake in a moderate oven (180\u00b0C, 350\u00b0F) for about 30 minutes, or until the top is just slightly browned on top (see top photo).

      "3 or 4 Italian sausages (not spicy)",

      "3-4 eggs",

      "A sprig or two of fresh parsley, finely minced",
      "Salt and pepper",
      "Freshly grated Parmesan cheese",
      "Olive oil"
    ],
    "instructions": "Make the rag\u00f9: This step should be done the day before, both because the rag\u00f9 itself takes several hours to cook and because it tastes much better the next day. Angelina always used her signature rag\u00f9 della domenica or Sunday sauce. Make sure that the rag\u00f9 is not too thick\u2014it should be quite loose\u2014loose enough to pour easily\u2014to account for evaporation as the dish bakes. Dilute with water if need be.\nMake the pasta: While lasagna di carnevale can be made with factory-made hard durum wheat lasagna, Angelina usually made her own fresh egg pasta (see this post for instructions). Unlike the pasta for lasagne alla bolognese, however, for this rustic dish you need to roll out your pasta rather thicker than usual; use setting '4' on most pasta machines. And I like to add a heaping spoonful of semolina flour for each 100g/1 cup of \"OO\" flour, to give the pasta a bit more 'bite'. Cut the pasta into large sheets that will fit into your baking pan. (I usually make mine big enough so that two sheets of lasagna will cover the entire pan.)\nMake the polpettine: The lasagna is stuffed with, among other things, polpettine, or little tiny meatballs. You should use the same mixture of beef, pork, cheese, bread and seasonings as you would for polpettone, or Italian meatloaf (see this post for the recipe) but make the meatballs just as small as you possibly can, no more than 2-3cm/1 inch round, at most, smaller if you can manage it, remembering that they will be placed between the lasagna layers. Then shallow fry them in light olive oil until just golden brown. The recipe for zitoni al forno con le polpettine, or baked ziti, gives details on how to make these little meatballs.\nFry the sausage (optional): In a classic lasagna di carnevale, the stuffing also includes long, thin sausages called cervellatine. They don't make them outside Campania, as far as I know. If you don't have them, you can either omit them and just use more meatballs, or cut up some 'sweet' Italian sausages and fry them in olive oil. (Or just slice up some of the sausages from the rag\u00f9.)\nMake the ricotta cream and cut up the mozzarella. Mix all the ricotta cream ingredients well in a mixing bowl with a spatula. Take a large ball of fiordilatte (mozzarella made from cow's milk) and cut it into cubes.\nCook the pasta sheets: Cook the lasagna sheets al dente, remembering that they will cook again in the oven. Since these sheets are thicker than the usual pasta and contain a bit of semolina, however, you will need to cook them for longer than other types of fresh pasta, say around 3-5 minutes, depending on how long they have been left to dry. If using factory-made pasta, follow the directions on the box. Do not crowd the lasagna or they may stick together; you may have to cook them in batches. When done, scoop them out with a slotted spoon and pat dry with a towel, taking care not to burn yourself with the hot water that will cling to the pasta sheets.\nAssemble the dish: In a large baking or 'lasagna' dish, which you will have greased with lard or olive oil, spread a bit of the rag\u00f9 over the bottom. Then cover the bottom with a layer of pasta. Since these pasta sheets are rather thick, avoid overlapping them. (You may have to trim the pasta with a knife or a pair of scissors, but that's fine.) Then cover the pasta with a generous layer of rag\u00f9. Top the rag\u00f9 with the polpettine and, if using, the sausage pieces, and then with dabs of the ricotta cream here and there. (You can add more grated cheese if you like, but in Angelina's version, there is ample grated cheese in the ricotta cream.) Then place another layer of pasta and repeat, until you've used up your ingredients. Top with a generous dusting of grated parmesan cheese and a nice layer of rag\u00f9. Drizzle with olive oil.\nBake the lasagna: Bake your lasagna in a moderately hot oven (180C, 350F) for about 45 minutes, until the top is just beginning to brown.\nStep 9: Serving the lasagna: When done, remove the lasagna from the oven and allow to settle and cool for at least 30 minutes. In fact, Angelina almost always made her lasagna ahead and reheated it gently, which gave it a rather firm texture and allowed the flavors to meld beautifully.",

    "instructions": "Prepare the filling by finely chopping the leftover roast in a food processor together with an egg or two, lots of grated parmesan cheese and, if you like, a few spoonfuls of the leftover sugo (gravy) from the roast. Season, if need be, with salt and pepper to taste. (A bit of nutmeg is also nice.) Make sure the mixture is quite smooth and not too dry. If it is a bit too stiff, add another egg.\nMeanwhile, you can make fresh pasta dough and cut it into rounds about 5 cm (3 in) in diameter\u2014or do what I did tonight, and use some 'Hong Kong style dumpling wrappers', ready-made round disks of 'pasta'. Brush them lightly with some water to help them stick together and then place a heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center of each disk,\nFold the pasta disk over and then seal the round edge by pressing down firmly with your fingers, starting at the center and working your way to each end with both hands. (This helps avoid the filling oozing out.) Proceed until you have used up your ingredients.\nYou can cook your mezzelune right away, or let them dry a bit before using. If, however, they are to wait for more than a half hour or so, cover them with a towel to prevent them from drying out too much.\nBring abundant well salted water to a soft boil, then add your mezzelune (being careful not to mangle them!) to the boiling water. Adjust the heat so that they boil gently. Do not allow the water to come to rolling boil or they may break apart. Cook for only 2-4 minutes, depending on how long they have been waiting around.\nWhen the mezzelune are done, scoop them out of the water with a large slotted spoon. You can dress them in a number of ways. Here are three possibilities:\nPerhaps the most common (and, to my mind, the best) way is to melt a good amount of butter (say 50g/2 oz per serving) in a skillet with some sage, allowing the sage to 'simmer' in the butter but not allowing the butter to color at all. Then add your mezzelune to the skillet, along with a bit of the pasta water and a bit of grated parmesan cheese. Toss together over medium heat very quickly and serve with additional parmesan on top.\nIf you have any gravy left over from the brasato, you can re-heat a bit of it in a skillet and toss the mezzelune in it. Serve with some grated parmesan on the side for those who want some.\nYou can also dress the mezzelune with a very simple sugo di pomodoro, known in the English-speaking world as a 'marinara sauce'.\nThese mezzelune are also very nice served in brodo, in homemade broth.",

    "ingredients": [
      "500g (1 lb) pappardelle pasta",
      "1 small duck, about 1 kilo (2 lbs), cut into 8 pieces",
      "1 medium red onion, finely chopped",
      "1 celery stalk, finely chopped",
      "1 carrot, finely chopped",
      "A few sage leaves, finely chopped",
      "100g (3-1/2 oz) pancetta, finely chopped",
      "A good glug of red wine",
      "1 large can of best quality peeled tomatoes",
      "Salt and pepper",
      "Olive oil"
    ],
    "instructions": "Cutting up the duck: You begin by cutting up your duck into eight pieces, in the same manner you would a chicken: two wings, two legs and the breast, separated from the back and cut vertically down the breast bone and then each half itself cut in half across its midriff into four pieces. The cut up duck, ready for cooking, should look like the photo at right. As you cut up the duck, make sure trim off any excess fat and skin from around the cavity or the neck. (Do not throw this away\u2014see notes below.) The back, the neck and the giblets (other than the liver) can be used to make an excellent stock, in the same way you make broth.\nGetting the sauce started: Then make a battuto of red onion, carrot, celery, a few sage leaves and pancetta, all finely minced. To make short work of the task, you can pulse these ingredients in a food processors (having roughly chopped them beforehand to ensure an even consistency) until you have a fine mince, almost\u2014but not quite\u2014a paste. Saut\u00e9 in abundant olive oil until very soft, then push what is now a soffritto to the edges of the pot and add the duck pieces, turning them frequently and allowing them to brown lightly on all sides. Season with salt and pepper and then splash a generous amount of red wine into the pot, turning the contents to allow them to absorb the wine.\nBraising: When the wine is entirely reduced, add a large can of peeled tomatoes, crushed with your hands or passed through a food mill, into the pot. Then tomatoes should nearly cover the duck pieces. If not, add water or broth. Cover partially and allow the duck to braise for an hour, stirring from time to time. If the sauce seems to be drying out, add a bit of water or broth. But more likely, the sauce will be a bit thin after an hour, so uncover and allow the sauce to reduce slowly for another 30 minutes or so.\nFinishing the sauce. A few minutes before the sauce is done, remove the duck pieces from the sauce. You can do one of three things with them: (1) you can keep them warm and eat them as a secondo after the pasta, accompanied by the vegetable contorno of your choice, (2) you can serve them on top of the pappardelle as a one dish meal or of piatto unico or (3) you can remove the meat from the bones and remove the skin from the meat, then chop the meat roughly and return it to the sauce. Personally, I prefer the third option, as duck that has braised this long tends to be a bit too dry for my taste to eat on its own. If you want to serve the duck as a secondo, some recipes call for braising the duck whole rather than in pieces which provides a better presentation and will also help avoid overcooking the duck meat.\nWhen the sauce is done\u2014it should be well reduced and darkened\u2014skim the excess fat from the surface. Depending on the duck, there may be quite a lot of excess fat. Some recipes call for you to make the sauce ahead and cool it, to allow you to remove the fat, but I find this is unnecessary and, in any event, you do want some fat in the sauce to add flavor and help it coat the pasta.\nMaking and saucing the pappardelle: Meanwhile, you can be making your pappardelle by mixing fresh pasta dough, rolling it out quite fine and cutting it into strips 2-3cm (1 inch) wide. In the alternative, if you lack the time or the energy to make your own, there are some quite fine pappardelle available commercially. Boil the pappardelle in abundant salted water until slightly underdone. Drain (but not too well) and return the pappardelle to the pasta pot, then add a few ladlefuls of the duck sauce, mix well, and allow the pasta to simmer in the sauce over moderate heat until it has almost entirely absorbed the sauce. Pour into a warmed serving dish and ladle additional sauce over the pasta. Serve your Pappardelle with Duck Ragu with grated parmesan cheese on the side for those who want it.",

      "A few sprigs of fresh parsley, finely chopped",
      "A pinch of red pepper flakes",
      "Salt and pepper"
    ],
    "instructions": "In a saut\u00e9 pan large enough to hold all the pasta, saut\u00e9 the garlic cloves in abundant olive oil over moderate heat until they are just beginning to brown. Remove the garlic cloves and add the chopped calamari. Season with salt and pepper, stirring so that all the little pieces are nicely coated with the flavored oil. Turn the heat down to very low and cover the pan.\nLet the squid braise until it is very tender, about 20-30 minutes for baby squid, 45-60 minutes for 'regular' squid. The squid will give off a fair amount of liquid to begin with, but as it cooks it may dry out, in which case add a few spoonfuls of water or wine from time to time to keep things moist. The squid itself should be much reduced in size and darken as its liquid cooks out; this is perfectly normal.\nWhile the squid is cooking, start the pasta water going, then prep your veggies.\nWhen the squid is done, uncover it, increase the heat to medium-high and add the white wine. Let the wine reduce, then add your veggies. Mix well to cover them completely with the sauce in the pan. Season well with salt and pepper as you stir.\nThen, once again, reduce the heat and cover the pan. Let the veggies braise until the mushrooms are tender, about another 10 minutes or so. The tomatoes will soften and begin to 'melt' into the sauce, but not completely. A minute or two before the end, add the red pepper flakes and half of the chopped parsley.\nJust when you cover the pan again, salt the boiling water very well and add your pasta, making sure that . it should be done about the same time as your veggies. When it is done very al dente, add the pasta to sauce in the saut\u00e9 pan. Lower the heat as low as it will go, and mix it all up so that the pasta is well coated with the sauce. If things are a bit dry or sticky, add some more pasta water to loosen things up. The pasta should not be at all watery but slight 'slither' around the pan easily.\nServe immediately in warmed pasta dishes. The best way to do this is to grab a good portion of pasta with some tongs (or a pasta fork) and swirl it into the dish. Then spoon out a nice portion of the sauce, with squid and veggies, too, on top of the pasta. If you like, sprinkle a bit of fresh parsley on top for garnish, perhaps with un filo d'olio\u2014a drizzle of olive oil. As the poem so rightly recommends, no cheese.",

    "ingredients": [
      "1 clove of garlic, slightly crushed",
      "1 sprig of fresh rosemary",
      "Olive oil (enough to cover the bottom of the pot)",
      "2-3 canned tomatoes, finely chopped",
      "1 large can (ca. 500g/1 lb.) of chickpeas",
      "200g (7 oz.) ditalini or other small 'soup' pasta",
      "250 ml (1 cup) water or broth, or enough to cover",
      "Salt and pepper",
      "Optional:",
      "50g (2 oz.) pancetta, cubed",
      "1 peperoncino (or chile de \u00e1rbol)",
      "A small handful of fresh parsley, finely chopped",
      "Grated pecorino or parmesan cheese"
    ],
    "instructions": "Saut\u00e9 the garlic clove in olive oil with a sprig of rosemary\u2014and if you want, the chopped pancetta, red pepper and/or parsley. (Each of these adds another layer of flavor.)\nWhen the aroma of the garlic and rosemary begins wafting about, add the tomato (add more if you like, depending on how 'red' you want the dish) and simmer for a few minutes. Add the can of ceci, well drained and rinsed, and allow them to insaporire (absorb the flavors of the tomato and aromatics) for 5 minutes or so.\nThen add water or broth to cover the ceci, simmer for another 5 minutes. To thicken the soup, either crush some of the chickpeas against the side of the pot or, for a more refined effect, scoop up about a third of them and pass them through a food mill back into the pot. They will 'melt' into the liquid and thicken the soup.\nThen add the pasta, which you should boil separately until slightly underdone. I usually use ditalini (also known as tubetti) but other small 'soup' pastas will also do fine (see below). Simmer for a minute or two more.\nWhen the pasta is cooked al dente, turn off the heat (adding a bit more water if needed) and cover the pot and allow it to rest for 3-5 minutes. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil or a good grinding of black pepper--or both. Some folks like to add grated cheese on top.",

On this late summer evening I used a store-bought mix of Baby Bella, oyster and shiitake mushrooms that worked very well. Reconstituted dried porcini or other mushrooms would also work fine (in which case you should add the mushroom water to the sauce and let it reduce along with the tomatoes).\nIn a pinch, you can even use button mushrooms, but your penne ai funghi will obviously be less interesting. One trick (not my own, but one I read about in one of Marcella Hazan's books) is to mix button mushrooms with reconstituted dried mushrooms: you first add the dried mushrooms to saute with the soffritto, then the chopped button mushrooms, then the filtered water in which you have soaked the dried mushrooms. Allow the mushroom water to evaporate. The button mushrooms will absorb the intensely mushroom-y flavor of the dried mushrooms and their liquid, turning them into a fair facsimile of wild mushrooms in the process.\nIf you want a vegan version of penne ai funghi, simply omit the pancetta.\nThe fresh sage lends a lovely subtle flavor to the sauce, but even better would be nepitella, an herb that is often described as a cross between basil and mint and sometimes called \"mint thyme\" in English. It is often paired with mushrooms in Italy but, as far as I am aware, not commonly found elsewhere.\nThis mushroom sauce also goes very nicely with fresh egg pasta, in particular with pappardelle or fettuccine.

      "1 egg",
      "Water, q.b.",
      "A pinch of salt",
      "4 medium potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced",
      "1 head of Savoy cabbage, cored and thinly sliced",
      "200g (7 oz) butter",
      "1-2 cloves of garlic",
      "A sprig of fresh sage",
      "200g (7 oz) bitto or another semi-soft Alpine cheese",
      "100g (3-1/2 oz) freshly grated Parmesan cheese"
    ],
    "instructions": "You make the pizzoccheri as you would any fresh pasta, but using 2 parts of buckwheat flour to one part regular wheat flour. (Buckwheat flour lacks gluten and needs some help to form a workable dough. Some recipes call for less regular flour, but the 2:1 ratio works well for me.) I use egg (and a bit of water) to bind the dough, but the original recipe (see below) calls for water only.\nRoll out the pasta rather thicker than other kinds of fresh pasta (I use setting \"3\" on my KitchenAid pasta roller) and let the rolled pasta sheets dry on a towel. Once dry enough, cut the sheets into strips, as wide as fettuccine or tagliatelle, say about 1 to 1.5cm (1/2 inch) wide and about 5-7 cm (2-3 in) long. Allow these little strips to dry out further while you prepare the rest of the dish (see photo above).\nWhile your pizzoccheri are drying, prepare the vegetables that will accompany them, typically potato and a leafy winter vegetable, most often Savoy cabbage. Slice or cube the potato, as you prefer (I like them sliced) and immerse them in cold water. Shred your cabbage and add it, too, to the water. Instead of Savoy cabbage, you can also use spinach, swiss chard leaves or\u2014as I did this time when I couldn't find Savoy cabbage at the market\u2014coste, or the stalks of swiss chard, trimmed of their leaves and cut into lengths about the same size as the pizzoccheri. Bring a large pot of water to the boil, salt generously, and add your vegetables.\nWhile the vegetables are cooking, melt a nice big piece of butter\u2014at least 50g/2oz. per serving to which you add a clove or two of garlic and a sprig of fresh sage. Allow the garlic and sage to simmer very gently in the melted butter until the butter is infused with their flavors. Do not allow the butter to brown; the garlic should brown, if at all, only slightly. Remove the garlic and sage when you're done.\nWhile the butter is simmering, either slice or shred some mild, semi-soft cheese, the most classic choices being the local cheeses bitto or Valtellina Casera. But since these cheeses are hard to find, even in Italy, outside their zone of production, fontina is often substituted. And if you can't find fontina, I'd recommend staying in the Alps and using either Gruy\u00e8re or Emmenthal. Grate about half that amount of parmesan cheese or grana padano. I like to use a lot of cheese as well, say 50g/2 oz. per serving, although you can use much less if you prefer a lighter dish.\nAfter the vegetables have been boiling for about 5 minutes, add your pizzoccheri and lower the heat a bit and continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes. Pizzoccheri take surprisingly long to cook for a fresh pasta\u2014if you taste after about 5 minutes, you may see that although the pasta is already al dente, there is a raw quality to it, due to the particular qualities of buckwheat.\nWhile the pizzoccheri are cooking, warm a serving bowl in the oven. When you are ready to serve, take your serving bowl out of the oven and, fishing them out of the water with a large slotted spoon, add a layer of well drained pizzoccheri and vegetables, then top with some of the cheeses, seasoning if you like with salt and pepper:\nWorking quickly, repeat until you have used up the ingredients, then pour over all the melted butter (which should be hot). This will partially melt the top layer of cheese. Then toss to mix the ingredients (don't overdo it) and serve immediately, while the pasta is still hot.",

Make sure there is a bit of pasta water clinging to the pasta; if not, add a ladleful from the pasta pot. Mix well and then add your egg mixture and mix again. Keep mixing until the eggs just being to thicken and form a creamy sauce that clings to the pasta. If you prefer (and these days I tend to like my carbonara this way) or if you are worried about contamination, you can continue a bit longer until the eggs actually set. In either case, remove from the heat as soon as it just bit less done than you want, as the eggs will continue to cook from the residual heat of the pasta.\nServe immediately in warm pasta plates with additional pecorino and ground pepper if you like.",

If using store-bought tagliatelle, follow the instructions on the box.\nWhile the pasta is cooking, saut\u00e9 the asparagus tips with a nut of butter, just long enough for them to absorb the butter and warm up. Do not let them brown.\nWhen done, drain and transfer the pasta to the skillet, along with a small ladleful of the pasta water, and mix it well with the asparagus pur\u00e9e over low heat. Let the pasta absorb the pur\u00e9e until it is well coated but slight quite slithery. You can add more water if things feel 'sticky'.\nServe with the saut\u00e9ed tips on top, either in individual warmed plates or in a communal bowl for the table, with grated parmigiano on the side for those who like it.",

    "ingredients": [
      "One batch of fresh egg pasta, made with 4 eggs",
      "One 'pie' pumpkin or butternut squash, about 500g (or 1 lb.)",
      "50-100g (2-4 oz.) amaretti cookies, finely crumbled",
      "50-100g (2-4 oz.) grated parmesan cheese",
      "50-100g (2-4 oz.) mostarda (pears and apples only)",
      "Nutmeg, salt and pepper, q.b.",
      "Breadcrumbs (if needed)"
    ],
    "instructions": "Cut open your pie pumpkin, cut it into large wedges and clean out the seeds and fibers with a spoon. Roast your pumpkin wedges in a moderate oven (180C, 350F) for about 45 minutes, or until the flesh is quite tender when pricked with a fork. (It's fine if the pumpkin browns a bit around the edges but you do not want a lot of caramelization.) Let the pumpkin cool, turning it over to allow any excess liquid to drain out. (If the pumpkin pieces seem watery still, you can wrap them in cheesecloth and squeeze them dry.)\nScrape out the cooked flesh from the pumpkin, leaving the skin behind, into a food processor. Add the amaretti, parmesan and mostarda, and process them until you have a perfectly smooth, stiff paste.\nSeason the mixture generously with freshly grated nutmeg, fresh ground pepper and salt. If the stuffing mixture is a bit soft or wet, mix in some breadcrumbs, a bit at a time, until the stuffing is stiff and rather dry.\nNow it's time to make your egg pasta, in the usual manner. (See this post on making fresh pasta.) Roll the pasta out rather thinly (setting 6\u2014or even thinner if you want\u2014on a pasta roller) since you will be folding the pasta into a double thickness, into long, rather slender sheets.\nPlace heaping teaspoonfuls of the stuffing about 5 cm (2 in.) apart along the length of your pasta sheet, just off center down the middle of the sheet (as pictured above).\nFold the longer half of the sheet over the stuffing, pressing down with your fingers all around the stuffing to seal the top and bottom layers of pasta together. With a serrated pasta cutter (if you have one, otherwise it's fine to simply use a knife) cut out your tortelli along the three unfolded sides:\nFor the final touch, you can ensure a tight seal while making your tortelli ever so pretty by pressing down the edges with the prongs of a fork like so:\nYou should cook your tortelli for a good 5-7 minutes, depending on the thickeness of the dough. They take a bit longer than fresh pasta usually does, because of the double thickness of the pasta and the filling. While the tortelli are cooking, gently melt lots of butter in a small saucepan, adding a sprig of fresh sage if you like to steep along with the butter. (I have read that the sage is not original to the dish, but I like it.) Serve immediately, topped with the melted butter and\u2014if you like\u2014more grated parmesan on top.",

Remove them from the frying pan as soon as they are nicely golden-brown and add more as you go, until you have used up all the mixture.\nMeanwhile, cook your ziti very al dente in abundant well-salted water. Warm some leftover rag\u00f9 and slice a large ball of mozzarella into thin slices, breaking them apart into bite-sized pieces.\nOnce these preparatory steps are complete, it is time to assemble the dish. Spoon a bit of the rag\u00f9 in the bottom of a baking dish, then add a layer of pasta. Nap the ziti with more rag\u00f9, arrange the polpettine here and there on top of the pasta and sauce, then pieces of mozzarella, then sprinkle it all with an ample amount of grated pecorino cheese. Add another layer of pasta and repeat until you've used up all your pasta. End with a layer of tomato sauce and ample grated cheese, drizzling a bit of olive oil on top to encourage browning.\nBake in a very hot oven (220C, 450F) for about 15-20 minutes, until the sauce is bubbling nicely and the top is lightly browned. Allow the dish to cool off for a few minutes, and serve.",

      "Broth (preferably homemade)"

    "instructions": "Make a soffritto: Gently saut\u00e9 the chopped or finely sliced onion in butter and/or or oil. (As I've mentioned before, you can add a pinch of salt and a drop of water to soften the onions as they cook to make sure they don't burn.)\nToast the rice: Then add the rice--a bit more than a handful, or 70-100g (1/3-1/2 cup) per person, depending on how hungry you are--and let it 'toast' in the soffrito for a few minutes-- just until the grains turn a chalky white color.\nAdd wine: Then add a splash of wine--almost always white, but red is possible in a few instances and, for a very special risotto, you can use champagne\u2014and let it evaporate.\nAdd broth ladle by ladle: Then add broth, ladle by ladle, allowing each ladleful of broth to evaporate before adding the next ladleful, stirring often. (There are some cooks who say it's only necessary to stir when adding the broth.) Repeat until the rice is 'al dente', which should take around 20 minutes.\n'La mantecatura': When the rice is cooked, you take the risotto off heat and, for most risotti, add a generous amount of grated parmesan cheese and, if you like, a bit of butter, mixing vigorously to create a creamy consistency. (This last step is called la mantecatura\u2014which I might loosely translate as enrichment, the idea being that by adding cheese and butter and agitating the rice kernels and releasing their starch, you give the risotto a rich, creamy texture.)\nOptional Rest: You should normally serve your risotto immediately. But for a slightly firmer risotto, you can cover and let it sit for a minute or two. If conversely the risotto is too stiff for your taste, stir in a bit of hot water, broth or cream to loosen it up.",

Mix the lentils and soffritto well, and let the lentils simmer for a few minutes to absorb the flavors.\n[NB: Many recipes have you simmer the lentils separately before adding them to the soffritto, but here I've opted for the one-pot approach. I haven't seen that it makes much difference to the end result.]\nThen add enough water or broth to cover the lentils by about 3 cm/1 inch. Cover and simmer the lentils over low heat for about 30 minutes or so, until the lentils are just about tender, stirring from time to time and checking to make sure they haven't dried out. (Add more water or broth if needed.)\nAdd the rice and a couple more ladlefuls of water or broth to the pot. Give it a stir and cover again, let the rice simmer until tender, about 10-20 minutes depending on the variety. Once again, stir from time to time and check to make sure things aren't drying out. Rice, like lentils, absorbs quite a bit of liquid.\nServe hot, with one or more of the suggested toppings if those who like them.",

Stir vigorously for 30 seconds or so, until the cheese and butter have melted and the rice has developed a nice, creamy texture.\nServe and eat your Champagne Risotto immediately, preferably by candlelight.",

    "instructions": "Begin by making the fumetto di scampi: shell the shrimp. Take the shells (and heads if you have them) and put them in a saucepan with one liter (1 qt.) of water, a splash of white wine, a pinch of salt and the usual odori: a small onion, a carrot and a stick of celery, cut up into chunks, along with a few sprigs of parsley. Simmer for about 20 minutes.\nThen make the crema di scampi: saut\u00e9 a lightly crushed garlic clove in a bit of olive oil. When the garlic just begins to give off aroma, add the shrimp and saut\u00e9 them as well. When the shrimp have just turned pink, add a splash a brandy and allow it to evaporate. (Some recipes call for you to set light to the brandy.) If you like, remove a few shrimp\u2014enough for one or two shrimp per person\u2014from the skillet as garnish. Then add the crushed canned tomatoes or passata di pomodoro and a ladleful of the fumetto, and simmer for about 20 minutes. Transfer this shrimp and tomato mixture to a blender, add the cream and blend on the highest setting until you have a very smooth, cream-like pur\u00e9e. Transfer this back to the skillet and allow to simmer for 10-15 minutes more to thicken the crema and concentrate its flavor. Make sure that the puree is well seasoned.\nFinally, make a normal risotto in bianco, with 400g of rice, using the usual technique (see Notes), beginning with a shallot or half a small onion saut\u00e9ed in olive oil and using the remainder of the fumetto in place of the usual broth. About halfway through the cooking time, add the crema di scampi and continue with the cooking. (You can hold back a bit of the crema for garnish. When the rice is fully cooked, add a dab of butter and proceed to mantecare. Let the risotto rest, covered, for 2 or 3 minutes before serving. If you like, garnish with a spoonful of the crema di scampi, one or two saut\u00e9ed shrimp and a pinch of finely chopped parsley.",

    ],
    "instructions": "The technique for black ink risotto recipe is a bit different from the more usual one, in that you don't begin by toasting the rice but rather braising the cuttlefish (or, squid, if you can't find cuttlefish). But before you start cooking, if your mollusk is not pre-cleaned, you will need to clean it, making sure to carefully remove and reserve the ink sacs (see below).\nNow, make a soffritto of finely chopped onion and garlic, saut\u00e9ed in olive oil. When the onion is soft and translucent, add your cuttlefish or squid (one small one or half a large one per person), which you will have chopped into little squares or sliced into thin strips, as you prefer. When the fish has turned opaque, add enough white wine to almost cover the fish and, if you like, a spoonful or two of passata di pomodoro (tomato pur\u00e9e) and/or a bit of peperoncino and/or some finely chopped parsley. Let the whole thing simmer until the fish is just about tender, which should take about 30-45 minutes depending on the type and age of the mollusk you are using. Then add the ink\u2014if you've cleaned the cuttlefish or squid yourself, use the ink from the reserved ink sacs or, if using cleaned squid, about a sachet of store-bought ink per serving\u2014and stir so that it is fully incorporated into the liquid, forming a smooth sort of black rag\u00f9.\nAdd rice, stir to mix well, and simmer until the rice has absorbed the black liquid. Now proceed as you would for any risotto, adding ladlefuls of broth, one at a time, adding more broth only as the previous ladle has been absorbed. Fish or vegetable broth do best, but you can use chicken broth in a pinch, or even water. When the rice is done, remove it from the heat, add some more parsley if you like, and stir it vigorously as you would to mantecare any risotto. Add a dab of butter if you must but do not add grated cheese.\nServe your squid ink risotto hot, topped with a bit of parsley if you like.",

      "Breadcrumbs"
    ],
    "instructions": "Start by making the rag\u00f9, using the ingredients listed above and following the method for Angelina's Sunday Sauce.\nPrecook the rice: Mix the rag\u00f9 and water together, season generously with salt. (Taste the liquid to make sure it is quite savory.) Put the rice and the liquid together in a saucepan, bring to a boil. Stir once, then lower the heat to a gentle simmer, cover and let cook for 15 minutes, stirring only once about halfway through. The liquid should be fully absorbed and the rice should still be slightly underdone, rather chalky to the tooth.\nThen transfer the rice to a large mixing bowl and let it cool entirely, then add the remaining eggs, cheese and parsley. Taste and adjust for seasoning\u2014the rice should be very flavorful. (NB: While the rice is simmering, you can let your dried mushrooms soak.)\nMake the polpettine: Mix all of the ingredients listed above together in a large bowl. Form them into the smallest meatballs you can manage, about the size of hazelnut, rolling them between your palms. Fry your little meatballs in abundant olive oil until they are nicely browned on all sides. Make sure that you leave lots of room in the pan for them to fry properly; you will probably need to fry them in batches. NB: Since they're so small, they will cook in only a few minutes. Drain them on paper towels.\nSet up your mis en place: Fish out a few of the sausages from the rag\u00f9 and slice them up. Slice the mozzarella and get your peas. You should now have everything ready to go: your rice, your soaked mushrooms, the little meatballs, the frozen peas, your sliced mozzarella. Lay them out on your work space so you're ready to put everything together.\nPrepare the stuffing: Mix together the sausages, meatballs, peas and mushrooms. Nap them with a ladleful of rag\u00f9 and mix so they are well coated. Taste and adjust for seasoning; the stuffing should be rich and savory.\nAssemble the sart\u00f9: Line a mold of your choice very generously with butter (or, if you really want to be authentic, lard) then breadcrumbs. (I like to use a Charlotte mold, but there are other possibilities; see Notes below.) Make sure to line the mold very well. This step is really important to avoid the rice sticking to your mold. And that would be a real shame after all the effort you're putting in...\nTake two thirds of the rice mixture and line the bottom and sides, leaving a large well in the middle for the stuffing. Make sure the rice makes a rather thick 'wall' around the sides, enough to hold up the finished timbale. Add the stuffing into the well, starting with a layer of mozzarella, then the stuffing ingredients, proceeding in layers until you're almost (but not quite) up to the top of the mold, like so:\nThen add the rest of the rice and flatten it out so it is flush with the top of the mold. Sprinkle with some more breadcrumbs and dot with some more butter (or lard).\nBake the sart\u00f9 in a moderate oven (180C/350F) for a good 30-45 minutes, depending on the shape and size of the mold, until the top is golden brown. (If using a ring mold or individual molds, it will be done in more like 20-30 minutes.)\nRemove the sart\u00f9 from the oven and let it rest for a good 10-15 minutes. (It can wait up to 30 minutes if you like and some recipes tell you to do so. The longer the wait, the more solid the sart\u00f9 will be.) Again, this step is critical to keep the sart\u00f9 in shape.\nUnmold the sart\u00f9 by placing a large plate over the top of the mold, then, using oven mitts or towels so you don't burn yourself, holding and flipping both mold and plate over together. Then, with the mold upside down on the plate, give the bottom (now the 'top') of the mold a good wack with a heavy knife or mallet or something to loosen it from the mold. Gently lift the mold up, just a smidgen, shaking it a bit until you feel the sart\u00f9 come loose from the mold and drop onto the plate.\nServe the sart\u00f9 whole, cutting it at table like a cake for your dinner guests, along with a sauce boat of the remaining rag\u00f9 and some freshly grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese for those who want some.",

      "1 chicken, preferably a stewing hen or free-range chicken, and/or",

    ],
    "instructions": "If your main objective is some flavorful broth, you add whatever meat(s) you're using to a large pot of cold, well-salted water. Tonight, I used a lovely free-range chicken and a beef shank:\nYou bring the meats just to the boil, skimming off the scum that inevitably rises to the top as it comes to the boiling point:\nWhile the water is coming to a boil, prep your aromatic vegetables. Immediately lower the heat to a very gentle simmer, skim off any residual scum and then add the vegetables to the pot:\nLet the meat and vegetables simmer until the meat is quite tender and the broth has a rich flavor. The total simmering time depends on the meat being used: chicken will take an hour or two, depending on the type of chicken, while beef will take about three hours. If you're using both and plan to eat the boiled meats, then you may want to remove the chicken so it does not completely overcook. The water should totally cover all the ingredients, so add more if the water reduces too much, as it will tend to do. Test for seasoning, and don't be shy about adding generous amounts of salt. Broth should not be bland.\nOnce the meats are cooked and the broth has developed good flavor, switch off the heat and let the broth cool a bit. You can even let it rest on the stove (uncovered) overnight.\nYou can also use the broth immediately if you like, but it has a deeper, richer flavor after this 'rest'.\n(Optional): If you want a clear broth --important when making a clear soup--strain the broth through the fine sieve or cheesecloth to remove the particles. (If you want a really clear broth, see note below.) If you wish to de-fat your broth, leave it in the fridge overnight; any fat will form a solid white layer on the top, which can then be easily removed.",

Remove from the oven and allow to cool off a bit.\nMeanwhile, in a saucepan, make a soffritto by saut\u00e9ing a finely chopped onion in butter (or butter and a bit of oil) until translucent and quite tender. (Adding a pinch or salt and a spoonful of water helps things along and prevents browning.) Scoop out the squash flesh with a spoon and add to the soffritto. Allow the squash to simmer gently for several minutes to absorb the flavors of the butter and onions, stirring often. The squash should become even softer and basically 'melt' in the pan into a kind of mush. Then add broth to cover and simmer for about 10 minutes or so.\nPass the squash and broth through a food mill, using the finest mesh disk, into a mixing bowl. Leave behind any fibers and bits of skin. You should have a perfectly smooth and even pur\u00e9e. Add that back into the saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer. Add heavy cream (or milk if you're counting calories or cholesterol), enough to thin out the pur\u00e9e into a beautiful, velvety consistency. Simmer for a minute or two more, so that the cream 'melds' with the squash pur\u00e9e, and serve.\nYou can top your winter squash soup with croutons, some finely chopped herbs, grated parmesan cheese and/or a drizzle of olive oil.",

(If you're pressed for time, you can use the 'quick soak' method\u2014see Notes below.)\nCook the beans and potatoes: The next day, in a large pot, simmer them with water to cover them amply with a bay leaf for an hour, or until tender. After about 30 minutes, add the potatoes to cook along with the beans. And when the beans are just about cooked, season them with salt.\nCook the bacon and sauerkraut: After you have the beans on the simmer, you can turn to the sauerkraut. Rinse it well and, if like me you like your sauerkraut rather mild, let is soak for a few minutes in water. Now gently saut\u00e9 the bacon in oil until it begins to render its fat, not letting it brown too much. Then add the onion and let it continue to saut\u00e9 until the onion is translucent. Drain the sauerkraut, rinse it once more and then, squeezing handfuls of it with your hands, add it to the bacon and onion soffritto. Mix well, sprinkle with caraway seeds and a bit of salt, then add enough water to almost cover the sauerkraut. Cover and let simmer over very gentle heat until the water has almost evaporated. It should be done at about the same time as the beans.\nAssemble and simmer: Take one or two ladlefuls of the beans and potatoes and pass them through a food mill back into the pot. Then add the sauerkraut and mix everything together well. Simmer it all, over the gentlest possible heat, for another 30-60 minutes to let the flavors meld. (Recipes vary enormously on how long this final simmer should take\u2014see Notes.) Make sure to stir from time to time to avoid scorching the by-now thick mixture. Add water to loosen the mixture to your taste.\nAdd the pest\u00e0: About 15 minutes before the final simmer is over, saut\u00e9 the garlic in the oil (or lard) until just lightly golden brown, then discard it. Add the flour to the oil and let it cook until it turns a light brown as well. Then add this mixture to the soup pot and mix well. (NB: If using minced salt pork, cook it first until the fat is well rendered before proceeding.)\nResting: Although la jota can be eaten right away, it is much better when made ahead and reheated. It you have time, eat it the next day. But it benefits from even a few hours' rest, if you make it in the morning for lunch or supper.",

Ideally, the pot will be made of terra-cotta, but a large enameled cast iron pot, or simply a stock pot, will do fine. Saut\u00e9 the flavor base ingredients together until they soften. Add the tomatoes and continue cooking until the tomatoes have melted.\nAdd the parboiled dried legumes and give them a turn with the flavor base so everything is well coated. Now do the same with the fresh legumes and fresh vegetables. Add the degreased pork broth and, if you need it, enough water to cover. (If you're not using the pig's foot, just use water or broth.) Simmer until everything is nice and tender, about 45 minutes to an hour.\nTowards the end of cooking add the chopped pork meat (if using) and, if you like, a handful of basil, mint and/or other fresh herbs to brighten the dish. If you have time, let the soup rest overnight and reheat the next day.\nIf using pasta, cook it separately until quite al dente, and add it to the pot a few minutes before you are ready to serve.\nServe with grated pecorino on the side for those who like it.",

Bring the beans to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer them until tender, about 45-60 minutes, depending on the beans.\nMeanwhile, make your soffritto: heat the olive oil in a casserole, preferably terracotta or enameled cast iron. If using the lardo, mince it finely and saut\u00e9 it gently in the olive oil until it has rendered most of its fat and slightly browned. Add the onion, carrot and celery, and let those saut\u00e9 gently, too, until they are tender and the onion has turned translucent.\nAdd the kale, mixing it well with the soffritto so the kale is covered with the seasoned oil and aromatic vegetables, then let it cook down until the kale is wilted and well reduced.\nWhen the beans are cooked, add them along with their cooking liquid to the casserole, topping up with water (or broth) if the vegetables are not covered. Simmer over a low flame until the kale is perfectly tender, about 30-45 minutes. Stir from time to time, and add water if needed to keep things loose. Along the way, you can crush some of the beans against the side of the casserole with a wooden spoon to thicken the soup.\nWhen the kale is tender, add the polenta to the casserole in a thin stream, stirring all the time so it mixes will into the soup without lumping together. Continue simmering until the polenta is fully cooked, usually another 20 or 30 minutes. Add more liquid if the farinata starts to dry out. It should have the consistency of porridge.\nServe while still hot, with a good filo d'olio (drizzle of olive oil) and freshly ground black pepper.",

    "ingredients": [
      "250g (8 oz) dried cicerhie",
      "A clove or two of garlic, left whole",
      "A bay leaf",
      "Salt",
      "1-2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped",
      "A sprig of rosemary (and a few sage leaves if you like)",
      "200-250g (7-8 oz) canned tomatoes, finely chopped",

    "instructions": "Soak the circerchie overnight. Drain and put them in a large pot with water to cover, together with a pinch of salt and a bay leaf. Simmer until tender. (Times will vary; traditional recipes say 2 hours, but the ones I used were tender in a little over an hour.)\nIn a heavy saucepan, Dutch oven or terra-cotta pot, gently saut\u00e9 the garlic and rosemary (and sage leaves if you're using them) for a minute or two, until the garlic is just golden. Add the chopped tomato and let it simmer for about 5 minutes, until it has thickened slightly. Remove the garlic and herbs.\nDrain the cooked circerhie and add it to the pot, mixing well. Let the cicerchie simmer for a few minutes to soak up the flavor of the tomato base. Add a ladleful or so of the pot liquor, enough to cover, season generously with salt and pepper, and continue simmering for another 10-15 minutes or so, stirring from time to time. Taste and adjust for seasoning.\nIf you like a thicker soup, crush some of the cicerchie against the side of the pot with a wooden spoon. Conversely, add more pot liquor if things get too thick for your taste.\nServe hot, drizzled if you like with some best-quality olive oil and some rounds of good crusty bread, toasted or (even better in my book) fried in olive oil.",

Have some more water on hand, simmering in a saucepan or kettle at the back of the stove.\nWhen the water has come to the simmer, add the cornmeal in a constant but gradual stream, stirring the pot all the while with a whisk or wooden spoon in one direction until all the polenta has been incorporated into the water.\nThe polenta will soon thicken. Turn down the heat to low immediately; be careful, as polenta has a tendency to spatter if it 'boils'. If this happens, take the pot off heat for a moment and add some water. That will stop the sputtering, and you can return to the heat and continue to stir.\nIf you have been using a whisk, you will eventually need to switch to a wooden spoon as the polenta thickens. Continue stirring and, when the polenta gets too thick to stir without great effort, add some of the hot water you have kept in reserve and continue to stir. if the heat is low enough and you keep the polenta rather loose by adding water from time to time, you only need to stir every so often\u2014say every 5 minutes or so. The polenta should simmer like this for at least 45 minutes, and it is even better after an hour. The polenta is done when it pulls away from the pot when you run your spoon across the bottom of the pot.",

    "instructions": "In a pot large enough to contain all your seafood comfortably, saut\u00e9 the onion, carrot, celery, parsley, garlic and red pepper flakes in abundant olive oil over low heart until quite soft. Add a pinch of salt as you saut\u00e9, taking care not to let anything brown.\nAdd the tomatoes to the pot and let them reduce for a few minutes into a saucy consistency.\nLay on the fish and other seafood, then add enough water to cover the seafood, along with the bay leaf and saffron if using. Simmer, uncovered, for a good 20-30 minutes, until the seafood is cooked through and broth is very flavorful. Taste and adjust for salt.\nRemove the fish and other seafood from the pot. Using a paring or boning knife, remove the skin and filet the fish. Cut the filets, if need be, into serving-size pieces. Place the fish filets and shellfish in a bowl and cover to keep warm. Discard the fish heads, skin and bones.\nPour the remaining broth through a fine sieve, pressing out the liquid from the solids, and return it to the pot, along with the seafood.\nIf you are using pre-cooked couscous, you should follow the measurements and instructions on the package, but using the fish broth or a 50/50 combination of broth and water instead of water. Generally speaking, the instructions will tell you to add pre-cooked couscous to hot liquid and allowed to steam off heat.\nBring the required amount of liquid to a boil, add the precooked couscous, together with the chopped almonds and spices, give it all a good stir and cover. Let the couscous stand for a good 5 minutes, or until the broth is fully absorbed and the couscous tender. Once the couscous is cooked, fluff it with a fork.\nWhen you are ready to serve, bring the broth back to the barest simmer to reheat the seafood.\nFor a family style presentation, serve the couscous in a large serving bowl, perhaps topped with more chopped almonds and a few pieces of seafood, with the fish soup in a separate soup terrine. Each diner can take a portion of couscous, and top it with the seafood and a good ladleful of the borth, to their taste. For a fancier presentation, you can plate individual servings as pictured here.",

      "Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, q.b.",
      "Butter"
    ],
    "instructions": "The filling I used this time was ricotta and swiss chard, which is almost identical to the more familiar ricotta and spinach filling. Taking a whole bunch of swiss chard, you trim the leaves from the stalks and blanch the leaves only in abundant vigorously boiling water for just 2-3 minutes. Drain and refresh immediately in cold water, squeeze out the water with your hands and chop the leaves finely. Then saut\u00e9 the chopped leaves in butter to remove any lingering liquid and allowing the leaves to absorb the butter. Transfer the chard to a mixing bowl, and mix gently with a healthy dollop of ricotta cheese, a handful of grated parmesan cheese, a pinch of grated nutmeg, salt and pepper.(You can add an egg yolk if you like for a richer and stiffer stuffing.\nCrespelle are, as mentioned, basically are crepes. But they are rather smaller than the average crepe\u2014only around 10 cm or so wide. You make a very thin batter (the thinner the batter, the thinner the resulting crespella) from 1 cup (250ml) of milk, into which you whisk 3/4 cup (125g) of flour, 2 whole eggs and a pinch of salt. (You can also add melted butter to the batter, which eliminates the need to melt butter in the pan.) You heat a small non-stick skillet over moderately hot heat, you drop a sliver of butter and allow it to melt, swirling it around to cover the bottom of the pan. Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the center of the skillet, immediately raise the skillet off the burner and swirl the batter around until it covers the bottom of the pan. (If it doesn't cover the entire bottom, you can always add a bit more batter to the bare spots\u2014it will 'merge' with the rest.) Allow the crespella to form a solid disk that will slide around the skillet, then flip it over and continue to cook until the other side is lightly spottled. Remove to a plate and repeat until you've used up all the batter. (Don't worry if your crespelle are not perfectly round, it will not be noticeable in the finished dish.)\nOne of the mother sauces of French cuisine, bechamel is also used in northern Italian cooking in all sorts of baked pasta dishes, including the classic lasagne alla bolognese. You can find my recipe here.\nThen stuff the crespelle with your filling, spreading a fairly thin layer on the 'underside' of each crespella, leaving a small margin around the edge of the disk. You then fold the disk into a triangle so as to resemble a handkerchief, and place 'pointy' side up, in a well-greased gratin dish. You continue placing the crespelle, slightly overlapping as if they were roof tiles, until you have filled the gratin pan (or run out of crespelle or filling!) Nap with bechamel sauce, grate over copious amounts of parmesan cheese, dot with butter, and you're ready to bake.\nBake in a hot oven (400 F, 200 C) for about 10-15 minutes. If the top is not nicely browned, pass the dish under a broiler until the surface is nicely spottled but not uniformly browned. Let the dish settle for 5 minutes or so and serve.",

Then add enough water or broth, mixing all the while, for the bread to start to come apart and form a fairly firm, uniform 'mush'. (It should be firm enough to eat with a fork, although you should use a spoon.)\nContinue simmering for about 5 minutes, then add the fresh basil leaves if using\u2014no need to tear or chop them\u2014stir and then take the pot off the heat and cover. Allow the pappa to rest at least 20-30 minutes and serve, topped with un filo d'olio and (if you're a pepperhead like me) freshly ground pepper.",

      "Salt",
      "Olive oil (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": "Preparing your steak for grilling. There are also certain preparatory steps that are critical to ensure the best results. If you get your steak from a good butcher, it should already be aged and rather dry to the touch\u2014as it should be. But if you buy your steak in a supermarket, it is likely to be rather wet, in which case it helps to air dry it in the fridge for a few hours or even overnight. Place the steak on a rack or\u2014if you don't have a rack\u2014you can prop it up with two chopsticks, over a plate to catch any blood that may drip out. This will allow air to circulate around the steak, top and bottom, so it dries evenly. Even so, turn the steak every so often to ensure even drying on the outside and circulation of the blood inside the steak. If you air dry your steak for more than a few hours, cover it loosely with a towel to prevent the meat from drying out too much.\nEven more important than air drying is tempering the meat: making sure that the meat is room temperature before you cook it. If you plan to eat the meat the same day you buy it, just leave it out until you plan to cook it (unless you live in a tropical or sub-tropical climate). But if you have refrigerated the meat, take it out of the fridge an hour or so before you plan to grill it, so that it come back to room temperature. This operation will ensure more even cooking.\nGrilling. Now get your grill nice and hot. (Some sources will warn against excessive heat, which supposedly can toughen the meat, but I have not found this to be true in practice, at least not with good quality meat.) Wood is the fuel of choice here\u2014oak is traditional\u2014or charcoal. If you must, a gas grill will do, although the final product will lack the characteristic smokey flavor of a true fiorentina. But don't sweat this too much; I make do with a gas grill myself. If you have a smoker box, pre-soaked chips of oak or another a mild wood will add character to your dish. Place the steak on the grill. If your meat is cut thick as it should be, lower the heat a bit, to 'medium-high', and grill it for five to ten minutes on each side, depending on the thickness of the steak (See notes below). If you like cross-hatched grill marks, place the steak across the grates diagonally, starting at 'ten o'clock'. Then, halfway through the cooking time for this side, turn the steak to 'two o'clock'.\nWhen you turn the steak over to cook on its other side, you will see the lovely cross-hatched grill marks that are the pride of so many 'grillmeisters' (see first photograph above). Now season the steak liberally with salt as the steak cooks on the other side, repeating the two and ten o'clock positions if you like. Turn the steak over and season it again on its just-cooked side. Finally, for a 3-inch monster, you can and should grill the steak on its flank for another five minutes or so, using the bone to prop the steak up. This will drive the blood away from the bone for more even cooking.\nThe total grilling time for a 3-inch monster fiorentina will be about 25 minutes (see Notes below for details on cooking times and testing for doneness.\nResting. After your steak is done, remove it from the grill and let it 'rest' for about ten minutes. This resting is another crucial step (perhaps the most crucial of all) that ensures that the meat will remain juicy when you carve it. Use a rack or chopsticks, just as you did for the air-drying, to ensure circulation all around the steak; this avoids the crust getting soggy underneath.\nCarving and Serving. A Florentine steak is too big to serve individually. It is typically carved up, first by removing the filet and then the contrefilet from the T-bone, then each against the grain. Each diner helps themselves to as much steak as they want. Many people serve the meat with lemon wedges, but as far as I'm concerned a sprinkling of salt\u2014and maybe pepper\u2014is all this steak needs!",

    ],
    "instructions": "If marinading your roast, place it in a bowl or container with the marinade ingredients and enough red wine to just cover. Leave overnight (and up to 24 hours) in the fridge. Turn the roast over once or twice as it marinates. Take the beef out of the fridge about an hour before you want to cook so it returns to room temperature. Pat dry.\nIf using a lean cut like eye round, it's not a bad idea to lard the roast. Here's an easy, 'homestyle' way to do it: Make slits all over the roast with a small parting knife and, with your fingers, insert small bits of pancetta into the slits. (See Notes for the professional method.)\nMake a battuto by finely mincing the onion, carrot and celery together, either with a sharp knife or mezzaluna on a cutting board, or in a food processor, until the mixture has almost turned into a paste.\nMelt a good knob of butter, along with a drizzle of vegetable oil, in a Dutch oven large enough to hold the roast, then add the battuto and gently sweat all the ingredients, with a pinch of salt, until they are very soft. Take care not to brown the aromatic vegetables\u2014a few drops of water will help them prevent browning and help soften them as well.\nRaise the heat and add the roast, browning it on all sides, again taking care not to burn the aromatics. Pour a ladleful of red wine (or the strained marinade if you've done that) over the roast and let it simmer, turning the roast now and then.\nWhen the wine is almost evaporated, add the broth or water, along with the soaked mushrooms. (If you're not making the mushroom garnish, you can add some or all of the soaking liquid, strained of any grit, as well.) Cover and let the roast braise over low heat until tender. (Times can vary, but 2-3 hours should be enough, although some recipes call for 4-6 hours of braising.) Adjust the heat so that the braising liquid simmers gently. Add more liquid (broth, water or mushroom water) if things get too dry.\nWhile the roast is braising, cut the fresh mushrooms into slices or quarters. Saut\u00e9 them briskly in a good knob of butter and a drizzle of vegetable oil. They will exude their juices at first, once they have evaporated, you will hear them begin to sizzle. At that point, they will begin to brown. If you are using rather bland mushrooms, you can add some or all of the soaking liquid from the dried porcini to the mushrooms, just as they begin to sizzle, and let it evaporate.\nWhen the beef is tender, remove it from the pot and let it rest for a few minutes. Meanwhile, check the braising liquid, which you will use as your sauce. It should be dark and intensely flavored, abundant but not too thin. Boil it down if it's too thin, and add water if need be to thin it out. The battuto should have completely melted into the sauce; if not, you can pur\u00e9e the sauce with a hand blender. If you're using the mushroom garnish, you can add it to the sauce if you like and let it simmer for a few minutes.\nSlice the roast on a serving platter and add the mushroom garnish all around it. Nap with some of the sauce. Place the rest of the sauce in a sauce boat for those who want more. Brasato is wonderful accompanied by mashed potatoes or soft polenta.",

    ],
    "instructions": "Marinade: Although it is not absolutely necessary, I find that the roast has extra depth of flavor if it is allowed to marinate. You place a beef roast into a ceramic bowl or pot into which it will fit snugly, then add the 'holy trinity' of onion, carrots and celery, each cut up into wedges or large chunks, a whole garlic clove or two, some whole peppercorns, a few cloves and a bay leaf or two. Pour over ample robust red wine\u2014usually you'll need a whole bottle. Leave the roast to marinate in its red wine bath overnight or even longer in the fridge. If the liquid does not entirely cover the roast, turn it every so often to ensure even marination. Let the roast come back to room temperature before cooking. (NB: Even if you don't have 24 hours to spare, you can marinate the meat for a few hours, or from the morning to the evening, in which case I'd leave it out of the fridge.\nBrowning: Remove the roast from the marinade and pat dry. Then, in a round or oval Dutch oven, melt about two spoonfuls of lard, add a sprig of rosemary and a garlic clove and brown the roast well on all sides, seasoning well with salt and pepper as you go. (Remove the garlic if it browns too much.)\nBraising: Then straining the marinade liquid through a sieve, pour it slowly over the roast. The liquid should come about 2/3 of the way up the roast. Lower the heat, cover the pot and allow it to simmer slowly until tender, about 2 or 3 hours (depending on the size of the roast), turning the roast every half hour or so to ensure even cooking. (Add some broth or water if it dried out too much, but normally there should be ample liquid without adding more.)\nFinishing the dish: When the roast is done, remove it from the pot to a carving board to cool off a bit. (This will make it easier to slice.) While it is cooling, bind the remaining liquid a bit in the pot either with some beurre mani\u00e9 or with a cornstarch slurry (see Notes). The resulting sauce should have a nice liaison without actually being thick. Slice the roast on a serving platter and pour over a bit of the sauce. Serve with the remaining sauce in a sauceboat.",

To keep them closed during cooking, you should tie them at each end with kitchen string into little bundles (as pictured) or skewer them with toothpicks.\nMelt some lard (or heat some olive oil) in a saut\u00e9 pan, then add the braciole and brown them lightly.\nAdd the onion and garlic, and season everything with salt and pepper. Simmer gently, covered, until the onion is very soft, turning the braciole from time to time. Add a bit of water if need be to prevent the onion from browning.\nUncover the pan, turn up the heat and add the red wine. Let the wine cook off, turning the braciole from time to time so they color evenly in the wine.\nNow add the tomato, mixing it well with the soffritto. Turn down the heat again, cover the pan and let it all simmer very gently for a good hour or more, until the meat is tender and the sauce dark and well reduced. Add some water if the sauce is getting too thick before the meat is done.\nTo serve, remove the string (if using) and lay the braciole, either home-style\u2014whole with a spoonful of sauce on top\u2014or, for a more elegant presentation, as picture above\u2014sliced, over a 'bed' of sauce. Keep the rest of the sauce to dress pasta, perhaps as a primo at the same meal.",

      "1 kilo (2 lbs) stewing beef, cut into cubes or strips",
      "Flour",
      "1 large onion, finely minced",
      "50g (2 oz) butter, plus a drizzle of vegetable oil",
      "Salt and pepper",
      "Red wine",
      "A variety of aromatic herbs and spices of your choice (see Notes)"

    "instructions": "Cut the beef either into cubes or large strips, as you prefer. Lightly flour the cubes or strips and brown them in the butter in a large braising pan until golden brown on all sides. The flame should be lively, but be careful to adjust the temperature so the butter doesn't burn. (A drizzle of vegetable oil helps to this end, even if it's not traditional.) Make sure the pieces are well-spaced so they brown nicely; proceed in batches if you need to. Remove the pieces from the pan as they're done.\nAdd the onion to the pan and saut\u00e9 gently until the onion is soft and translucent, seasoning with salt and pepper as you go. Add back the beef and turn everything together, seasoning again. Let the beef and onions simmer together for a few minutes, then add enough red wine to barely cover the beef. Nestle the herbs and spices in the pot among the beef pieces.\nCover and let the pot simmer very gently until the beef is perfectly tender, about 1-1/2 to 2 hours, depending on the quality of beef and the size of your pieces. Be sure to stir from time to time, as the sauce tends to stick to the bottom of the pot. Add more wine or water if need be to keep things moist and loose, but let the sauce reduce towards the end.\nServe piping hot over freshly made polenta.",

    ],
    "instructions": "If you are using tender, lean beef, then you want to opt for the quick version. In Italy, they sell thinnish (but not paper thin) slices of beef called fettine di manzo or just fettine. If you can't find anything like that, you can use boneless steaks (as pictured). If they are any thicken than say, 2 cm (1/2 inch) then I would suggest that you cut them into half thicknesses. In either case, pound your slices with a meat pounder or the back of a heavy skillet. Pat each slice dry to ensure good browning.\nAdd enough olive oil to nicely coat the bottom of a heavy skillet. Turn the heat to high and when the oil is very hot, quickly brown a clove or two of garlic (taking care that it does not burn) then add the beef slices and sear them quickly on each side. They should be just lightly caramelized. Don't crowd the slices which, as you probably know, would impede proper browning\u2014you can do them in batches if need be. Remove the slices as they brown.\nAdd an ample amount of best-quality canned tomatoes, which you can simply crush with your hands, to the oil. (In the summer, if you have really good ripe fresh tomatoes, you can chop them up roughly and use them instead.) Lower the heat, season with salt, pepper and a nice sprinkling of dried oregano.\nAfter the pizzaiola sauce has simmered for a minute or two, add back your beef slices and continue to simmer away for about 10 minutes, until the sauce has reduced nicely and the meat is fully cooked through. You want to keep your sauce simmering at a moderate pace\u2014not too slowly or the sauce will not reduce, but not too quickly either, which would tend to toughen the meat.",

You can even let the loaf cool completely if you prefer. Do not skip this step, however; it is crucial to allow the loaf to come together and firm up a bit. If you don't, the loaf is likely to fall apart when you slice it.\nWhen you are ready to serve your polpettone, reheat the sauce.

Then pass each chop in some beaten egg, seasoned with salt and pepper, and then in bread crumbs, pressing the bread crumbs into the chops to make sure they adhere well.\nHeat a generous amount of butter\u2014a whole stick\u2014in a skillet, over moderately high heat, allowing the butter to foam up. When the foaming subsides, add the chops. Don't crowd them, but at the same time, if you leave too much empty space in the skillet, the butter may burn. Regulate the heat so that the chops brown nicely with the butter darkening too much or burning. (Adding a bit of vegetable oil helps prevent the butter from burning.)\nWhen the chops are nicely browned on both sides, serve immediately, sprinkled with some sea salt and, if you like, lemon wedges on the side.",

Like a chicken, you start by separating thighs and legs (two sets rather than one) from the carcass. But you will quickly notice a few differences. First of all, rabbit bones, though quite thin, are much harder than chicken bones, so you'll need to strong knife or cleaver to cut through them. And the body of the rabbit is quite a bit longer; it has a mid-section called the 'saddle' rather than a breast, running along its backbone than needs to be cut into sections. For a detailed description of how to cut up a rabbit, see this useful article.\nBegin cooking by saut\u00e9ing a soffritto of finely chopped garlic, rosemary and sage in olive oil, over gentle heat in a large saut\u00e9 or braising pan or casserole, preferably of terracotta or enameled cast iron. When the soffritto is just lightly golden, raise the heat to medium high, add the rabbit pieces and turn them so that they are even coated with the aromatics. Saut\u00e9 the rabbit until it, too, is lightly golden on all sides. Then season with salt, black pepper and red pepper flakes. Pour over some red wine and allow the wine to evaporate completely.\nAdd about 2 tablespoons of best-quality tomato paste in about a cup of water, along with a bay leaf, to the pan. Mix well, lower the heat again to a very gentle simmer, cover the pan and let the rabbit braise for about 20-30 minutes. Add a bit more water if the pot dried out.\nWhen the dish is done, the rabbit should be quite tender and the sauce, being quite reduced, should coat the rabbit pieces. Serve hot.",

Lay some parchment paper over the thigh and pound it lightly with the back of a skillet to flatten it a bit more.\nThe roast at the moment looks rather a mess, but no worries. Make sure this messy \"inside\" of the thigh is face up and all will be well in the end!\nPrepare some frittatine (little frittatas) by whisking together the eggs, cheese, salt and pepper in a bowl. Heat a little oil and/or a knob of butter in a small non-stick skillet over moderate heat and pour in one small ladleful of the egg mixture\u2014just enough to cover the bottom of the skillet. Let the egg set on one side, then flip it over to set on the other side, as if you were making a very thin, crepe-like frittata. The eggs should brown only very lightly.\nWash the spinach well, then, while it's still wet, add it to a large saucepan over moderate heat. Let the spinach cook just until wilted. Remove the spinach from the saucepan and run it under cold water to stop it cooking, then squeeze it dry. Chop the spinach finely and then add it to a skillet, where you will have lightly saut\u00e9ed a clove of garlic in olive oil and then removed it. Let the spinach absorb the flavor of the garlic-scented oil for a few minutes, seasoning it with salt, pepper and just a soup\u00e7on of grated nutmeg. Turn off the heat and let the spinach cool.\nNow it's time to assemble your roast: Season the inside of the turkey thigh with salt and pepper, then lay on the saut\u00e9ed spinach, leaving a slight border at the edges. Lay the frittatine over the spinach, then the ham slices, like so:\nNow starting at one of the short ends, roll the turkey thigh up as tightly as you can manage. Tie the roll with cooking twine.\nRub the whole roast with with olive oil, then season it generously with salt and pepper. Lay the roast in a roasting pan, which you will have greased with olive oil. Arrange some potatoes around the roast if you like. Drizzle everything with some white wine.\nRoast in the oven at 190C/375F for about an hour, basting with some more white wine from time to time, until the roast is cooked through and nice and golden brown on the outside. If in doubt, insert a meat thermometer into the bottom of the roast; the temperature should read 74C/165F. At this temperature the meat will be perfectly safe to eat but still nice and juicy.\nLet the roast rest for at least 15 minutes. Then cut the roast into 1cm/1/2 inch slices and serve, along with any juices in the roasting pan.",

      "1 roasting chicken (see Notes)",
      "Salt and pepper",
      "Olive oil",
      "2-3 mild Italian sausages",
      "2 slices of day old bread, trimmed of its crust and soaked in milk, then squeezed dry",

      "A handful of fresh parsley, finely chopped",
      "1 garlic clove, finely chopped",
      "Salt and pepper, to taste",

      "2-3 chestnuts, roasted, peeled and crumbled up (optional)",
      "1-2 garlic cloves, slightly crushed but left unpeeled",
      "A sprig or two of fresh rosemary",
      "White wine",
      "3-4 firm-fleshed potatoes (see Notes), peeled and cut into wedges, and tossed with a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper"
    ],
    "instructions": "Prepare the stuffing by mixing all the stuffing ingredients listed above together in a bowl with a wooden spoon or spatula. Make sure they are well amalgamated. The mixture should be very savory; if in doubt, take a small amount of stuffing and fry it, then taste for seasoning. (Since it is made from raw pork and egg, you shouldn't try it without cooking it first.)\nTake the stuffing and fill the chicken's cavity, leaving some room as the stuffing tends to expand a bit while the chicken cooks (although not nearly as much as a bread stuffing does).\nNow truss the bird. My method for trussing a chicken is simple: First, cut off a nice, long piece of kitchen twine. Tie the two legs together, then draw the string down the backside of the bird until you get almost to the other end, then draw the string around the thighs, all the way around the bird until you've gone full-circle. Tie up the loose end and you're done.\nPlace the bird in a baking dish just large enough to hold it. Give the bird a good rub down all over with olive oil. (If you don't like greasy hands, you can use of pastry brush.) Then season the bird well with salt and pepper, again all over. Lay a spring of fresh rosemary along side the bird, and throw in a clove or two of garlic, slightly crushed to release its flavor, but left unpeeled so it doesn't burn in the heat of the oven. Splash a bit of white wine over everything.\nNow place the chicken into a moderately hot oven (190C/375F) with the convection function on. Roast the bird for 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of the bird. Make sure to baste the bird from time to time with white wine and its cooking juices.\nIf you want potatoes with your chicken, peel them and cut them into wedges, toss them in a mixing bowl with a good pour of olive oil and generously season them with salt and pepper. About 30 minutes or so before the bird is due to be done, add them to the baking dish all around the bird.\nThe bird is done when you prick it with a knife and the juices run perfectly clear. (If you have a meat thermometer, it should register an internal temperature of 75C/165F.) Take the chicken out of the oven and let it rest for 15-20 minutes, loosely covered with tin foil. The cooking juices can be deglazed with some more white wine and used as a delicious sughetto (or sauce) for the bird. If you give everyone a bit of chicken, stuffing and potato, and they'll be happy...",

Then season the bird by rubbing salt and pepper into the skin of the bird and drizzling olive oil all over it.\nOnce your bird is stuffed, seasoned and trussed, you roast it. The best way is to use the rotisserie on your barbecue. Set some aluminum pans with some water or wine in them below the bird to catch the drippings, and turn on the burners to each side, but not those directly beneath the bird. If you have a rotisserie burner, turn that on as well.\nStart your rotisserie turning, close the lid of your barbecue and let the chicken roast until it is golden brown all over. The internal temperature should reach around 70 C/160 F. Roasting should take about 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of your bird.\nIf you don't have a barbecue rotisserie available, you can also roast your chicken, on a rack, in a hot oven (200 C/400 F). If your oven has a rotisserie, so much the better. If you don't have a rotisserie function, you will want to baste the bird from time to time with a bit of wine or olive oil to keep it moist.\nAfter the chicken has been roasted, leave it to rest, tented with aluminum foil, for about 20-30 minutes before serving. Serve the chicken, cut into pieces, sprinkled with salt and, if you like, decorated with your favorite aromatic herbs for a bit of color and aroma. You can use the delicious drippings as a sauce, reducing it if need be in a small saucepan.",

Simmer gently about 30-45 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through, turning the chicken pieces at least once. Add water if needed to keep things moist and, about halfway through, the rosemary leaves. By the time the chicken is cooked, the pan juices should be well reduced; if not, continue simmering uncovered for a few minutes.\nServe the chicken hot, napped with the pan juices.",

      "1 young chicken, cut into 10 pieces (see Notes)",
      "1-2 cloves of garlic, peeled and slightly crushed",
      "1 sprig of fresh rosemary",
      "250-350g (8-12 oz.) of fresh mushrooms (or a handful of dried imported mushrooms, soaked until soft)",

Remove both garlic and rosemary from the pan.\nPat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels, dust them ever so lightly in flour and add them to the oil, raising the heat a bit. Brown the pieces on all sides, turning them from time to time for even cooking. Season generously with salt and pepper.\nAdd a generous amount of white wine, enough to come up about 1 cm (1/4 inch) up the pan. Turn the chicken pieces in the wine for a minute or two so they are covered well, then lower the heat and cover. Let the chicken simmer gently until it is cooked through and tender. For a young chicken, this should take about 30 minutes. For older or larger chicken the cooking time may be upwards of 45 minutes to an hour.\nAbout halfway through the cooking time add your mushrooms. If you are using reconstituted dried mushrooms or very tender fresh ones, you can simply cut them up roughly and add them raw (see Notes). (If using dried mushrooms, add their water, too, as it has lots of flavor.) Then re-cover the pan and continue simmering until the chicken is done through.\nWhen the chicken is done, uncover and remove the chicken pieces to a warm serving platter. Check the consistency of the sauce. If it is a bit watery, raise the heat and let it reduce a bit. Taste and adjust for seasoning. Then nap your chicken with the mushrooms and sauce. Top with a bit of minced parsley, if you like, for color\nServe immediately, while still hot, with some nice, crusty bread and a crisp white wine. (Giusti-Lanham and Dodi recommend a Durello or Pinot Grigio.)",

    "instructions": "If you bought the turkey breast whole, skin and butterfly it. Lay it out flat on a cutting board, messy side up.\nNow begin to make the filling: Boil the chard for about 5 minutes, drain it and rinse it under cold water. Squeeze out all the water with your hands, lay the chard on a cutting board and chop it finely. Saut\u00e9 the shallots (or onion) in the butter over gentle heat until it is perfectly soft, adding a pinch of salt and a few drops of water to prevent it from browning. Add the chard, mix well so that the onion and butter are well incorporated into the chard, and simmer for another 5 minutes or so. Let the chard cool. Add the chard to a large mixing bowl, then add the other filling ingredients and stir everything very well, until you have a uniform mixture. The mixture should be quite stiff; if need be, add more breadcrumbs, a bit at a time, until you've reached the right consistency. Taste and adjust for seasoning\u2014the mixture should be very savory.\nLay the filling on top of the turkey breast, allowing a margin of at least 3 cm (1 inch) around the sides. Don't pile the stuffing too high, as it will expand during cooking and make a mess. Then roll the breast up gingerly, taking care not to let the stuffing fall out. Truss the breast up with string as you would a roast.\nIn a braising pan, preferably oval, just large enough to accommodate the roast, saut\u00e9 the garlic clove until it is just lightly brown, then remove it. Raise the heat to high, add the roast and brown it well on all sides, seasoning well with salt and pepper.\nSplash a bit of white wine on top of the roast, turning it to coat it on all sides. Now cover the pan, lower the heat and let the roast braise until it is done through, about 30-45 minutes depending on the size of the roast. Add a bit more wine or water from time to time to keep the pot from drying out. It is done when a meat thermometer registers 75C/165F. The meat should be fully cooked through, without a trace of pink, but don't overcook it. As we all know, overdone turkey breast can be terribly dry.\nRemove the roast from the pan and let it rest on a cutting board for at least 15 minutes.\nSlice it rather thinly (but not paper-thin) and serve in a serving dish, accompanied by the cooking juices for those who would like some.",

    "instructions": "Take a nice pork loin roast. Depending on from what part of the loin the roast is taken, it may have had a bone removed from its interior and been tied. If so, untie the roast. If not, then 'butterfly' the roast so that it opens up like a book.\nRub the inside of the roast with dry marinate made from rosemary leaves, garlic, salt and pepper. (Some recipes also call for sage.) This marinade can be chopped in a food processor, but do not over-process--they marinade should remain rather rough.\nRoll and tied up the roast. With the aid of a paring knife, 'lard' the roast by inserting more of the marinade into the meat at regular intervals. Rub the exterior with any remaining mixture and pour over a bit of olive oil (see photo below). You can start to roast the arista immediately, but it will have more flavor if you leave the meat to marinate for several hours, or even overnight.\nIf your barbecue has a rotisserie feature, then skewer the roast and place it above a drip pan in the barbecue, into which you can pour some white wine. Then grill over moderate indirect heat (i.e., leaving the burners directly under the roast off or, if using a charcoal grill, pushing the charcoal to the sides), lighting the rotisserie burner if you have one to aid in searing the roast to a beautiful golden brown. If you don't have a rotisserie burner, you may want to turn up the bottom burners to aid browning.\nDepending on the size of your roast, let it cook for 45-60 minutes. Check the internal temperature after about 30-45 minutes. Pork is well done at 160 degrees Farenheit (about 70 Celcius).\nRemove the roast from the fire a few degrees under this, as it will continue to cook. Let it rest at least about 20-30 minutes before serving. It can also be served at room temperature--in fact, if you ask me, it's even better that way.\nNB: Don't throw out the drippings in the pan--they are delicious poured over the roast. Reduce them in a saucepan if they are too thin.",

If the pork is done before the milk has reduced\u2014which is likely if you are using a pork loin or tenderloin\u2014then remove it and keep it warm while the milk continues to simmer, then return the roast to the casserole to reheat when the sauce is ready.\nIf you are having a family-style meal, you're done. Just slice the roast, nap with the sauce and serve. It will not be particularly pretty but it will be very tasty. If you want a more elegant effect, then you can do one or both of two things: add some heavy cream to the milk, which will cause the sauce to amalgamate, and continue simmering until the sauce is dark and smooth (see photo). You can also blend the sauce (with or without the additional of cream) to a smooth and perfectly even consistency.",

Strain and add your just cooked lentils to the soffritto, allowing them to simmer together for a few minutes, then add a ladleful or two of rich broth or the lentil cooking liquid or, best of all, the juice from the cotechino (see next paragraph). Simmer long enough for the flavors to meld and the lentils to become entirely tender.

Then lay out of 'bed' of the lentils in a large serving platter, then the cotechino slices in a pleasant arrangement on top of the lentils.

Remove the hocks from their liquid on to a cutting board. Score the skins of your pork hocks in a crosshatch patterns with a sharp knife. Let them cool off and air-dry for a few minutes before proceeding.\nWhile the pork hocks are cooling, mince all the dry marinade ingredients together very finely, until you have a kind of paste. (A food processor makes short work of this, but for a finer result, chop the ingredients first with a knife and then grind everything together with a mortar and pestle.) Apply this paste all over the hocks, taking special care to make sure it gets into the crevices where you've scored the skin and on any exposed meat. If you have time, let the meat rest to let the marinade penetrate into the meat, as long as overnight\u2014but even a hour will do.\nGrease the bottom of a large baking dish or roasting pan with olive oil, then put the hocks in. Roast them at 180C/350F for 45-60 minutes, basting with white wine (or some of the simmering liquid if you prefer) from time to time.\nWhile the hocks are roasting, in a large mixing bowl, dress the potato wedges with the olive oil, salt and pepper.\nRemove the hocks from the oven. Surround the hocks with the dressed potato wedges, then nestle the rosemary and garlic cloves among them. Put the pan back in the oven and continue roasting and basting for another 45-60 minutes, until the pork hocks and potato wedges are both tender and nicely golden brown on the outside.\nLet rest for a few minutes before serving.",

Continue cooking, stirring often, until the cabbage has reduced down quite a bit. (You can cover it between stirs, which allows it to steam in its own liquid, which quickens the process.)\nWhen the cabbage has reduced in volume by about half, you can add some diced apple if you like, which gives the dish a slight sweetness. Stir again to mix the apple evenly into the cabbage. You can also add a few fennel seeds, which adds another layer of flavor.\nThen add the sausages back into the pan, nestling them into the cabbage at even intervals, and pour in enough broth (or water) to almost cover the cabbage. Lower the heat, then cover the pan, and let the dish simmer for a good 45 minutes to an hour, until the cabbage is literally melting and the sausages are quite soft, too. If there is a lot of liquid left in the pan, raise the heat to high and boil it (almost completely) off.\nAdjust for seasoning and serve immediately on a warmed platter or straight from the pan.",

    "instructions": "Take some thickly cut shoulder lamb chops, one or two per person depending on whether you are serving other courses and the appetite of your dinner companions. Bone and trim the chops of excess fat. (NB: Don't try to remove all the fat, just the really thick swaths of it. You want some fat to moisturize the meat during its rather long cooking time.) Cut the meat into cubes and add to a large mixing bowl. Then add a healthy splash of white wine, a pour of olive oil, one medium sliced onion, fresh rosemary, salt and pepper, and mix the ingredients well. If you have the time, allow the meat to marinate in this mixture for at least an hour and up to a day ahead.\nWhen you are ready to cook, add chunks of potato, about the same size of the lamb cubes. Use as much potato as you like; I find that a 1:1 ratio of potato to lamb meat by weight produces a fine result. Mix the potatoes and lamb meat, then pour the entire mixture into a baking dish large enough to hold it all without it coming, say, any more than 5cm (3 in) up the sides of the dish.\nBake in a hot oven (200\u00b0C, 400\u00b0F) for about a half an hour covered, then remove the cover, raise the heat a bit and allow the casserole to continue cooking until the lamb and potatoes are tender and nicely browned, about 30 minutes more. The lamb will have shed quite a bit of water in the first half of cooking; the liquid should evaporate, but not quite completely, by the time it is done. Mix the lamb and potatoes from time to time to baste and allow the pieces to cook evenly, but leave the dish alone for the last 15 minutes or so, so a nice brown crust forms on top. If you find that the lamb has given off a lot of grease, you can skim the excess off with a spoon but, once again, do not skim all of the fat off, as it provides both moisture and flavor.\nWhen the dish is done, remove it from the oven and allow it to cool and settle for a few minutes before eating. It can be made ahead and re-heated as well, and only improves if you do so.",

    "instructions": "Marinate a nice butterflied leg of lamb in a mixture of olive oil, salt and pepper to taste, two crushed garlic cloves and a sprig or two of rosemary. You can either whizz these together in a food processor or simply sprinkle them directly on the meat, as you prefer. Obviously, the first method will result in a more assertive flavor. For best results, let the lamb marinate overnight in the fridge, wrapped in plastic (a plastic freezer bag also works nicely). If you don't have that much time or haven't planned ahead, no worries; even an hour or two will lend flavor. If you've refrigerated the meat, take it out of the fridge and allow it to come to room temperature (this should take about a half hour or so).\nGrill the lamb directly over a hot fire, about 10-15 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of your meat, until nicely crusted on the outside and pink, or medium-rare, on the inside.\nAllow the meat to rest for a good 10-15 minutes, then slice it against the grain and place the slices over a bed of baby arugula. Season the whole liberally with salt and pepper, then drizzle with olive oil and, if you like, a few drops of lemon juice. If you like, some parmesan shavings would not hurt.",

    "instructions": "If you're fresh anchovies are frozen, let them thaw out completely. This can be done fairly quickly by immersing them in tepid water. Drain them entirely.\nNow take an anchovy and slit it horizontally down the belly. Cut off the head, then with your fingers, gently open the two sides of the fish up to expose little 'vein' (actually the viscera) and backbone.\nScrape out the vein, then with the help of your paring knife, very gingerly detach the backbone from the fish, slipping the knife under the bone to detach it, then using it to hold down the fillets while you lift the bone away from the fillets with your fingers, taking care to avoid separating the two fillets from each other. (If they do separate, it's no real problem, but it will be a bit less pretty.) Stop when you get to the tail. Cut the backbone off just below the tail, keeping the tail attached to the two fillets.\nYou can rinse the fillet off so it's perfectly clean if you like. Keep going until you've cleaned all your fillets.\nLay out the flour and seasoned egg in separate bowls and pour enough oil in a skillet to come up about 2cm (3/4 inch) up the sides. Heat the oil until it's quite hot but not yet smoking.\nNow, using the tail as a 'handle', dredge each anchovy in the flour, then in the egg, then place it gently in the hot oil. Repeat with more fillets until the skillet is full, but not crowded, with fresh anchovies. Fry on both sides until nice and golden brown, adjusting the flame if you need to to maintain the oil at a hot but not smoking hot temperature. The oil should bubble vigorously around the edges of the fresh anchovies.\nOnce golden brown, remove the anchovies to a platter lined with paper towels or, even better, a baking rack, to dry off a bit.\nJust as soon as you've fried all your anchovies, arrange them on a serving platter, season generously with salt, and serve them right away with lemon wedges on the side.",

The exact timing will depend, of course, on the size of your lobster; for doneness, check to see that the tail flesh is opaque and quite firm to the touch.\nNow serve the lobster in its shell, with a bit more marinade drizzled on top.

      "1 kilo (2 lb) dried codfish",

      "A handful of parsley, finely chopped",

      "Olive oil",
      "Milk",
      "200g (7 oz) freshly grated Parmesan cheese",
      "More olive oil"
    ],
    "instructions": "Begin, as mentioned, by soaking the baccal\u00e0 in water. Depending on how long it has been cured, baccal\u00e0 can take as much 24 hours to soak, or as little as 8 hours for some lightly salted, relatively fresh varieties. In any case, for this dish, which is seasoned with anchovies, you will want to make sure that the fish is well soaked and almost all of its saltiness removed. Change the water several times during the soaking period. If in doubt, taste a bit of the baccal\u00e0; if it is still very salty, keep soaking.\nMeanwhile, make a soffritto by sweating an ample amount of thinly sliced (or finely chopped) onion\u2014about half as much as the fish by weight\u2014in olive oil until quite soft and translucent. Season with some salt and pepper, and add a few anchovy fillets and a handful of chopped parsley. As soon as the anchovies have 'melted' into the soffritto, turn off the heat.\nOnce the baccal\u00e0 is ready, dry the fillets thoroughly, cut them into relatively even square pieces and dredge them in flour. Spread a spoonful or two of the soffritto on the bottom of a casserole dish, preferably of terracotta, then lay the pieces of baccal\u00e0 over the soffritto, snugly but in a single layer.\nSpread the rest of the soffritto on top of the baccal\u00e0. (If you have more fish than will fit in a single layer, then add just a bit of the soffritto on top of the bottom layer, place another layer of fish on top of that, and then spread the rest of the soffritto on top of the second layer. If you have more fish than will fit in two layers, then your casserole is too small!)\nPour over enough milk to just barely cover the fish pieces. Then sprinkle the top with abundant grated parmesan cheese. (This is one of the relatively rare cases in Italian cooking where fish and aged cheese are combined\u2014an exception that proves the rule.) Then drizzle the whole with a generous filo d'olio.\nNow you have two choices: either you can simmer the dish on top of the stove\u2014over very gentle heat\u2014or you can place the dish in a moderate to slow oven (no more than 180\u00b0C/350\u00b0F, but better at 150\u00b0C/300\u00b0F). The dish should just barely bubble as it cooks. In either case, the baccal\u00e0 should simmer for about 3-4 hours, shaking the pan once in a while to avoid the bottom burning or the fish sticking, but not stirring, until the the liquid is almost entirely consumed and the fish is very tender. Your patience will be richly rewarded, as the flavor of the dish is absolutely ambrosial!\nServe your baccal\u00e0 alla vicentina with soft polenta, preferably the polenta bianca that is typical of the Veneto, but in a pinch your average yellow polenta (as pictured above) will do fine.",

    "instructions": "You begin, as usual, by soaking the salt cod for up to 24 hours in several changes of water. Drain the cod, pat it dry, and cut it into serving pieces.\nNow make your sauce, in a skillet or flame-proof baking pan, by very lightly saut\u00e9ing a soffritto of chopped garlic and parsley in olive oil until it just begins to give off it fragrance. Immediately add roughly chopped very ripe tomatoes (or, the in winter, canned tomatoes) and simmer gently. When the tomatoes start to melt into a sauce, toss in a handful each of capers\u2014preferably the salt-packed kind, rinsed and dried\u2014and olives\u2014preferably the small black Gaeta or Ni\u00e7oise variety.\nWhile the sauce is simmering, lightly flour and fry your baccal\u00e0 pieces in olive oil until they are lightly browned. As they brown, transfer them to the pan or skillet with the sauce. When all the baccal\u00e0 has been added to the sauce, take a spoon and nap a bit of the simmering sauce over the fish pieces.\nNow you have a choice: you can continue simmering the dish over the stove, or you can place the dish in a hot oven (200\u00b0C, 400\u00b0F) for 10-15 minutes, until the sauce has reduced to a nice consistency. I like the oven method, as serving the baccal\u00e0 direct from its baking dish makes for an attractive presentation at table.\nRemove the dish from the oven, sprinkle with a bit more chopped parsley for color, and serve with some nice, crusty bread.",

(A few drops of water and a pinch of salt will help.)\nWhile the aromatics are cooking, cut the bodies of the squid into strips or rings. And cut up the tentacles if they're large. Add the squid to the soffritto and let it saut\u00e9 with the aromatics for a few minutes to allow them to become infused with their flavor, to insaporire, as the Italians call it. Add the tomato paste (and the red pepper flakes if using) and let simmer with the liquid for a few moments to blend.\nNow add the chopped greens and mix with them up with the squid pieces, adding water if they absorb all the liquid. Lower the heat, cover and let things simmer very gently for a good 20 minutes, adding water if needed to keep things a bit brothy. Test the squid to see if it's tender, if not, give it a few more minutes. Taste and adjust for seasoning\nServe hot, with toasted slices of good, crusty bread on the side.",

About halfway through, when the baccal\u00e0 is already pliable, cut it into long, slender fillets, perhaps about 7-8 cm/3 inches long and 4 cm/1-1/2 inches wide or so. This will speed up the process of softening and de-salting the fish (see Notes below).\nAt least 2 hours ahead, whisk together in a large bowl the flour and enough mineral water so you have a smooth, silky, liquid but fairly thick batter (about the consistency of a pancake batter, if you're familiar with that.) Let it rest until you're ready to cook.\nHeat up a deep skillet with enough olive oil in to come up at least halfway up the side. Drain the salt cod fillets and pat them dry. Then, when the oil is hot enough, but not smoking hot. dip each fillet in the batter, then into the oil. Keep adding fillets but make sure not to crowd the skillet too much. Fry at a moderate heat, turning from time to time, until the fillets are golden brown on all sides. This should take about 10 minutes or so, but no more.\nAs your fillets are done frying, drain them on paper towels or on a baking rack. Serve them as soon as they're all done, with lemon wedges if you like, and a light sprinkling of salt.",

Either way, however, by the end of the cooking, the fennel is likely to have broken up, which is perfectly fine.\nUncover the fennel and raise the heat to cook off all the excess liquid in the pan, turning (or flipping) the fennel frequently. If you like, you can let the fennel go a bit longer to caramelize it a bit. Season generously with salt and pepper.

Or you can add some fresh herbs if you like, like rosemary or marjoram.\nGrease a gratin dish large enough to hold your fish fillets in a single layer (which, if you like, you will have rubbed with a split garlic clove) and into which you lay the fennel to make a 'bed' for your fish.\nSeason the fish fillets with salt and pepper and lightly oil them as well.

Total time will depend on the thickness of the fish. The general rule of thumb is 10 minutes per inch (3 cm.) of thickness. But you will probably need more time for small fish, so that it has time to brown nicely. A minimum would be 5 minutes per side over a hot flame. If you have a larger fish that needs longer cooking, then use a moderate flame to avoid the skin burning. Take care with the tail, as well, as it tends to burn quickly; you can either cover it with aluminum foil or position your fish so that the tail gets only indirect heat.\nWhen the fish is fully cooked, place it on a serving platter, drizzle with best quality fruity olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, then with a bit of finely chopped parsley.

The sauce should, in all events, be very flavorful.\nSet the sauce aside in a bowl and turn to your swordfish. Rub a bit of olive oil on your steaks, just enough so it glistens, and sprinkle them with salt. To cook them, you typically grill them, but if it's winter outside (as it is where I live) you can run them under a hot broiler or sear them in a skillet. Make sure they are nice and browned on at least one side. Be aware: having very firm flesh, swordfish takes a bit longer to cook than other kinds of fish and, at least to my taste, is not all that pleasant to eat when underdone. On the other hand, it can dry out so don't overdo it; 3 or 4 minutes per side for thin steak (see below) should do the trick.\nPlate your swordfish steaks and drizzle some sauce on top. Serve any extra sauce in a bowl for those who want more. Make sure to have some crusty bread at the ready to soak up any leftover sauce.",

Give the leeks a good mix and let them sweat for a minute or two. Then add a drizzle of water and cover. Let the leeks stew for 10-15 minutes, until they are very soft, stirring from time to time and adding another drizzle of water if things get too dry. Take care not to brown the leeks at all.\nWhen the leeks are soft, uncover and turn the heat up a bit to let any excess moisture cook off. When you just start hearing the pot sizzle, turn off the heat.\nNow lay out the sheet of puff pastry on a cutting board or other clean surface. In the center, lay over a thin 'bed' of the braised leeks about the size and shape of the salmon fillet. Lay the salmon on top of its bed, then cover the fillet, top and sides, with the rest of the leeks.\nNow take the sides of the puff pastry and fold it over the salmon and leeks to make a neat package, trimming off any excess pastry. You can use the trimmings to cut out decorative shapes to lay on top of the package. Or if you like, you can make a decorative latticework as pictured (see Notes in blog post for detailed instructions).\nTransfer the package to a baking sheet. (If not using the latticework top, prick the top here and there.) Beat the egg yolk and milk until smooth and brush the resulting egg wash all over the top of the pastry.\nBake in a hot 200C/400F oven for about 20-25 minutes, until the pastry is puffed up and golden brown all over and the fish is cooked through.\nLet the salmon rest and cool off. Salmone in crosta in best served warm but not hot. It is also perfectly lovely at room temperature.",

    "instructions": "Fill a very large stockpot about halfway with water, and add the aromatics and bring to a boil. Let the aromatics cook for 15 minutes.\n[NB: If you don't have a pot big enough to handle the various cuts of meat, you can use separate pots. In fact, some of the secondary meats, especially those that are quite fatty and/or strongly flavored like the tongue and the cotechino, are usually cooked separately anyway. Some recipes call for you to cook the hen or chicken separately as well, so as not to mix different flavors.]\nHow begin adding your meats in the order that they usually take to cook, starting of course with those that take the longest. Here is a list summarizing typical cooking times: 3-1/2-4 hours : Beef hoof, ox tongue; 3-3-1/2 hours: Brisket, chuck, bottom round, rump, shank, ribs and short ribs, oxtail; 2-2-1/2 hours: Veal tongue, hen, calf's head, large cotechino/zampone, veal trotter; 1 or 1-1/2 hours: Chicken, small cotechino; 1/2 hour: Pre-cooked cotechino\nCalculate things so that everything will be done at the same time. So, for example, if you were cooking brisket, tongue and a chicken, you would start with the brisket, start the tongue an hour later and then the chicken an hour later and cook for an hour more.\nStart the water off at a brisk boil, but after that maintain a steady but gentle simmer, skimming off any scum that comes to the surface as you need to and topping the pot up with more water if too much cooks off. If one meat is tender before another is done, just remove it from the pot into a bowl, moisten it with some broth from the pot, and cover it loosely; add it back to the pot at the end to reheat. Once cooked, the meats can stay off heat (or on minimal heat) almost indefinitely, until you are ready to serve.\n[NB: If cooking veal or ox tongue, you will need to remove it when it's done and skin it. Then return the tongue to broth to re-heat before serving. See our post on Gratin\u00e9ed Ox Tongue in Mushroom Cream Sauce for details.)\nWhile the meats are simmering, they need little attention, and you can get on with the business of preparing sauces and sides.\nWhen you are ready to serve, lay out the meats on a large, pre-heated platter. Ladle over some of the broth to moisten the meats. Bring the platter to the table, along with the sauces and sides, and slice the meats at table for each of your guests.",

They will be done when they are tender but still have some bite to them, which will take, say 45-60 minutes.\nPrepare the tomato sauce in a large casserole large enough to contain all the ingredients: Make a soffritto by saut\u00e9ing the onion, garlic and parsley gently in lard (the traditional choice) or olive oil, seasoning while the odori are cooking. Add your canned tomatoes, pur\u00e9eing them by passing them through a food mill into the pot.

Simmer it all for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to get to know each other.\nServe hot.

    ],
    "instructions": "Start by taking a non-stick skillet and saut\u00e9ing your sausages in a bit of olive oil over moderate heat. When they are nicely browned, you can remove them to prevent them from getting too brown, or just keep them in the pan.\nNow add your onion and potato and let them go until they are nice and tender, and not too brown. Season with salt and pepper as they saut\u00e9. I find that it helps to add some water and cover the skillet for a few minutes. This speeds up the cooking time and prevents burning.\nOnce the potato and onion mixture is done, add back the sausage pieces if you've removed them. Let them saut\u00e9 together and get to know one another for a minute or two. If you are using the parsley, now is the time to add it to the mixture.\nWhile the filling ingredients are getting acquainted, it's time to make your egg base: Beat the eggs and grated cheese together in a bowl. If you are using pecorino, you should not need much salt, but with parmesan you will want to season the eggs a bit.\nPour the egg mixture over the filling ingredients in the skillet and mix once with a spatula or wooden spoon.\nOnce the flavoring ingredients are more or less evenly distributed though the eggs, stop and let the eggs cook, still over moderate heat, until they have almost entirely set, except for a thin layer of raw egg on top, and the bottom has nicely browned (but not too much). During this step, too, you can cover the skillet with a lid to help the eggs set. The whole process should not take more than 8-10 minutes. Use a spatula to check the bottom to make sure it's browning nicely but not burning. Regulate the heat if need be.\nNow comes the tricky part: you need to flip the frittata over. I do this by using two plates. You slip the frittata out, cooked side down, onto a dinner plate. Then top that plate with another, and flip the two plates over, so that the frittata is now upside down, with the runny, uncooked side facing up.\nAdd a little more olive oil into the empty skillet, then slide the frittata back into the skillet. You will now want to let the runny side cook. This will take a lot less time than before, as you eggs should have already almost completely set, perhaps 3-5 minutes more. Again, check the bottom by raising a bit of the omelette with a spatula and take a peek underneath. It may look a bit misshapen at this point, but not to worry, all will be well in the end.\nWhen the frittata is done, slide it out onto a dinner plate again. I find that the last-cooked side is the most attractive, so once again, I use another plate and flip it over onto its 'pretty' side.",

Then, fry a ladleful at a time to a well oiled frying pan and brown on both sides to make little frittatas, following the basic technique for making frittatas\u2014with the major difference that, given how very thin these frittatine are, they will only need a minute or two on each side.\nAs each frittatine is done, set them aside and let them cool completely while you make the next one. When they are all done, roll them up and cut it into thin (1cm or 1/3in) strips.\nWhen the sauce is done, add the egg strips to the saucepan, along with the extra grated cheese and/or mint if you like, and mix everything well.\nAs soon as the mixture comes back to the simmer, serve, with grated cheese on the side for those who want some more.",

When the onion is soft and translucent, add the garlic, mix and let it simmer for just a few moments. (Add the red pepper flakes now, if using.)\nNow take a food mill and place it over the pot, then pass the canned tomatoes through the mill into the pot. (If using the passata, just add it to the soffritto.) Add the basil leaf and let the tomatoes simmer, still over gentle heat, for about 10-15 minutes, until they have cooked down a bit and formed a sauce.\nNow crack open your eggs, one by one, and gingerly drop them into the tomato sauce. (I usually open the eggs into a small bowl or cup and then slide the egg into the sauce. This helps avoid breaking the yolk and, if it does break, you can discard it before it's in the sauce.) Cover the pan and continue simmering the eggs in the sauce until the whites are set and the yolk has 'glazed over' but are still soft inside.\nServe immediately with some nice crusty bread to soak up the sauce.",

(In this case, hold back on fresh herbs, mixing them into the salad until just before serving.) The tomatoes will exude some of their juices, which are perfectly delicious for sopping up with some crusty homemade bread.\nFor a more decorative presentation, you can top the salad with some additional fresh herbs. Basil leaves are particularly pretty.",

As for any frying, make sure your wedges are well spaced; work in batches if you need to.\nRegulate the heat so that the artichokes don't fry at a moderate pace, neither too quickly or too slowly. Turn the artichoke wedges so they brown evenly on both sides. Test one to see if it's done; it should be crisp and golden brown on the outside, but completely tender on the inside. Drain the artichoke wedges on paper towels.\nWhen all your artichoke wedges are done, turn them onto a serving platter, salt lightly and serve immediately, with lemon wedges on the side.",

Drain them and let them cool.\nWhile the sprouts are cooling, prepare the batter. Whisk together the flour and water, then mix in the grated cheese, salt and olive oil. Separate the eggs. Whisk the yolks into the batter. Whip the whites until they form soft peaks (you'll want an electric whisk for this until you have really strong arms) and fold them gingerly into the batter.\nHeat the oil in a deep fryer until it's moderately hot, say 180C/360F. Mix the Brussels sprouts in the batter until they are all well coated. One by one, pick the sprouts out of the batter with some tongs, shake them gently to shed the excess batter, and plop them gingerly into the hot oil, taking care to avoid splashing the hot oil. Deep fry the sprouts for about 5 minutes, or until they have browned to your liking.\nServe while still warm, sprinkled generously with salt.",

Then cut the onions in half across their midsection, against the grain so to speak, so their rings are exposed.\nPlace the onion halves in a well-oiled baking dish, cut side up. Season very generously with salt and pepper, then sprinkle with the parsley. Finally, drizzled the onion halves with best quality olive oil. (See picture above.)\nPlace the baking dish in a moderate oven (180C/350F) for an hour or more, until the onions are well reduced in size, very soft and slightly caramelized. Baste the onions with their cooking juices every so often as they cook. Be careful not to allow the onions to burn, which will give them a bitter taste. I like the cover them with a sheet of wax paper for the first 30 minutes or so. If need be, you can lower the oven temperature.\nOne little personal touch: about 5 minutes before they're done, I like to splash a bit of white wine on top of the onions. This gives the onions a very slight tang, which nicely balances their natural sweetness, and produces a little 'sauce' (sughetto) you can pour over the onions when you serve. them.\nLet the onions cool slightly before serving.",

    "instructions": "Cut the eggplants into good-sized chunks. Toss them into a colander as you go, sprinkling them generous with salt. When you're all done. let them sit in the colander for a good 30 minutes or more.\nNow set yourself up with lots of paper towels at the ready, and another colander or bowl. Take whole handfuls of the salted eggplant, lay it on a paper towel, then wrap up the eggplant chunks and gently squeeze to dry them as completely as possible. Drop the dried eggplant into the second colander. Repeat this procedure until you have used up all the eggplant.\nFry the eggplant chunks in abundant oil until they are just lightly brown around the edges. The eggplant should be tender, but not meltingly so. Lay the fried eggplant out on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil.\nWhile the eggplant is purging per Step 2 above, cut the tomatoes into rough chunks, about the same size as the eggplant. Heat some olive oil in a skillet wide enough to hold them all in a single layer and toss in the garlic cloves. When the garlic is just beginning to give off its aroma (no more than a few moments) add the tomatoes and saut\u00e9 them over a very brisk flame until they have cooked down. They will have melted into a kind of sauce, but with some chunkiness left in them. If you've made the tomato ahead of time, you can just let it rest off heat until you're need it.\nAdd the eggplant to the tomatoes in the skillet. Mix everything together very gingerly to avoid turning the eggplant (which should be quite tender) into mush. If you have the skill, the best way is to toss the ingredients around in the skillet. If you're not up to that, then a spatula will do a more delicate job than a wooden spoon. Let the eggplant and tomatoes saut\u00e9 over very brisk heat, tossing them from time to time, almost as if you were doing an Asian stir-fry, for a few minutes to let the flavors meld. Just before you're done, add in the fresh basil and parley and finish the cooking.",

Make sure to immerse the potatoes in a bowl of water as you peel them, and slice them quickly, to avoid disclosing.\nJust as soon as you're done peeling and slicing, pat the potato slices dry with paper towels. In a large mixing bowl, dress the slices with generous amounts of olive oil, salt and pepper, along with a few rosemary leaves and one or two cloves of garlic which you will have minced as finely as possible. (Here's one case when a garlic press comes in handy.) Set aside.\nTake a large baking dish and rub the insides all over with the cut side of another clove of garlic which you will have sliced in half. Arrange the potato slices evenly in the dish, partially overlapping the top layer of potato slices like roof shingles, in a decorative pattern in the dish: lined up in rows if your dish is square or rectangular, in concentric rings if it's round or oval. Add enough water to come up about half the height of the potatoes\u2014it's best to drizzle the water in at the sides of the dish so as not to displace the dressing. Drizzle the top of the potatoes with some more olive oil and sprinkle with some more salt. Finally, place a sprig of rosemary on top of the potatoes.\nRoast the potatoes in a moderate (180C/350F) oven for about 45-60 minutes, until all the water has evaporated, the potato slices are soft inside and golden brown on top and around the edges. (Just how brown is a matter of taste\u2014I like mine fairly lightly brown, as pictured.) If the potatoes are not brown enough for you, you can run them under the broiler for a minute or two, till they're done to your liking. Remove the rosemary sprig and let the dish rest for a good 1o minutes or so before serving directly from the baking dish.",

If you're cooking for company, you can remove the garlic at this point for a more elegant presentation. But at home I just leave them in for extra flavor (and it wards off vampires, too!)\nAdd your raw spinach leaves with the water that clings to them, along with a sprinkling of salt. Toss the spinach leaves well and they will quickly begin to wilt under the heat of the hot oil.\nAllow the spinach to simmer and absorb the flavors of the soffritto for just a couple of minutes, until the spinach is well reduced and tender. Adjust the seasoning to taste.\nAnd that's all there is to it!\nNow, if you are using more mature spinach\u2014the kind with dark green, crinkly leaves and thick stems\u2014you should trim the leaves of their stems and blanch them for a minute or two in salted water before saut\u00e9ing. They are easy to trim: just hold each leaf in your hand on each side of the stem. Then pull the stem off with your other hand\u2014it should come off easily. Drain them before adding them to the soffritto. Some recipes, in fact, call for rinsing and squeezing them dry, but, except for specific uses where you really need a 'dry' vegetable (such as in a filling for stuffed pasta) I generally leave a little bit of moisture on the vegetable, and that's the way that Angelina used to do it.",

      "2 Tbs dry active yeast",

      "100g (3-1/2 oz) mealy potato, steamed, peeled and mashed",

    "instructions": "Proof the yeast by mixing it with 50g (2 oz) of the flour and the water in a small bowl. Cover the bowl and let it sit in a warm place (like inside of a turned off oven) for about 30 minutes. It'll be ready when it 'bubbles'.\nIn the bowl of a standing mixer, using the paddle on low speed, mix together the rest of the flour, mashed potato, butter salt and sugar until it has taken on a grainy consistency. Then start adding the eggs, one by one. Stop the mixer and add the proofed yeast, then continue until you've achieved a uniform, very stick dough.\nGrease a ring mold very well. (NB: Do this even if you're ring mold is supposedly non-stick; trust me, it helps.) Gather up the dough into a ball with a spatula and place it in the mold, evening it out as much as you can. The sticky dough can be hard to handle, but persist; it is easiest to use your hands for the operation.\nCover the mold with a towel and let is sit for an hour or two, until it has at least doubled in volume, filling up the mold.\nPreheat the oven to 180C/350F. Place the mold (uncovered) in the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes, until the dough has turned golden brown on top and a paring knife or toothpick inserted into it comes out perfectly clean. Remove from the oven and let the cake cool in its mold for about 10-15 minutes.\nWhile the cake is cooling, make the syrup: Add water and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Simmer for about a minute, then add a good splash (or two) of rum. Simmer for another minute or so. (NB: If it's more convenient to make the syrup ahead of time, make sure to reheat it before proceeding to the next step.)\nAfter the cake has cooled off a bit but is still warm, prick the top of the bab\u00e0 all over with a paring knife or other sharp object to perforate the surface. Spoon the rum syrup, little by little, all over the top of the cake and around the edges, too, so it runs down the sides and reaches the bottom of the mold. Continue until you've used up all but a few spoonfuls of the syrup. (If garnishing the bab\u00e0 with mixed berries, save another spoonful for that, too.) Let the cake sit in its mold for another 10-15 minutes to allow the syrup to penetrate it completely.\nTurn the cake over on to a serving platter and unmold it. Spoon the remaining syrup over the top, and fill the center, if you like, with crema pasticcera, whipped cream or mixed berries. And now for my little special chef's secret: if you want some extra oomph, drizzle more rum over the top of the cake, as much as you like...\nWhen the cake has completely cooled, slice, serve and enjoy!",

(This should be very quick and take only a few seconds.)\nRemove the pot from the heat and let it cool off a bit. Then add the eggs, one by one, mixing well with a wooden spoon until each is well incorporated into the dough. Let the dough cool completely. It will be quite sticky and soft.\nTo fry your bign\u00e8, take two spoons and scoop up a spoonful of the dough with one of them. Then, passing the dough from one spoon to another, form a roundish little dough. (NB: It will be close to impossible to make perfectly round sphere with this wet dough.) Then flick your dough ball into the fat. Then proceed with the rest of the dough, until your skillet is filled (but not too crowded) with little bign\u00e8.\nThe fat should be only moderately hot at first. The dough balls will puff up almost as soon as they hit the oil. Nudge them gently as they fry. They will rotate very easily. When they have all lost their raw look and are nice and puffy, raise the heat and continue frying over high heat until the bign\u00e8 are all golden brown. Remove them with a slotted spoon to a platter lined with paper towels or a baking grid to drain and cool. Repeat until you've used up all your dough.\nIf you have more dough to fry, remove the skillet to a cold burner to let it cool off a bit. (If you add your next batch to oil immediately, the oil will be too hot and the bign\u00e8 will brown before they have a chance to puff up properly.) After a minute or two, you can add your next batch of bign\u00e8 into the oil off heat, the oil will still be hot enough to start them cooking. Then put the skillet back on the flame and continue as for the previous batch.\nAfter all your bign\u00e8 are done, let them cool off completely. At this point, you can simply sprinkle them with powdered sugar and serve. Or, for a richer version, you can fill them first with crema pasticcera (see Notes).",

Knead the mixture for a good five minutes until you have a nice, elastic dough. (If using a KitchenAid mixer, use the paddle to mix the ingredients, then switch to the hook to knead the dough on slow.) Wrap your ball of dough in cellophane and then a towel and let it rest for at least an hour.\nDivide the two into two parts and roll it out just as if you were making fresh egg pasta. If using a pasta machine, roll it to a medium thinness (notch 3 on a KitchenAid mixer pasta attachment).\nThen cut the dough out into the shape(s) you like with a fluted pastry wheel. The most typical, perhaps, is the rectangle that is partially split in the middle as pictured above, but Angelina favored simple ribbons (see photo below). Some folks like to pinch the ribbons in the middle to create little 'bow-ties'.\nDeep fry the dough shapes in moderate hot oil. (Not too hot: remember dough fries very quickly and if your oil is too hot, it may darken too much.) They should puff up immediately, especially if you've used a bit of baking powder. Turn them often with a slotted spoon so they cook evenly. Fry until they are just golden brown, not too dark. (The dark ones don't look as pretty but they are still good\u2014you can exercise you cook's prerogative and enjoy them yourself in the kitchen while no one is looking...)\nDrain the fried chiacchiere on paper towels and let them cool. (They can be served lukewarm or at room temperature.) Before serving, dust them with confectioner's sugar. I like to toss them delicately the a bit of sugar first, then top them with a further dusting. They are at their best eaten immediately but are still good for a day or two after they are made.",

    "ingredients": [
      "1 kilo (2 lbs) cherries, pitted and split in half",
      "200g (7 oz) sugar",
      "Juice of one lemon",
      "1 or 2 strips of lemon zest"
    ],
    "instructions": "The easiest way to pit cherries is to use a special instrument invented for the purpose. One arm has a little perforated 'cup' for cradling the cherry, the other a tiny 'lance' for skewering the cherry and forcing the pit out.\nRemove the stem (if any) and place the cherry in the little cup, the stem end facing the lance, and squeeze both arms together. Ideally, the pit should simply pop out though the hole in the cup. Sometimes this doesn't actually happen, but no worries, the cherry will have opened up enough so that you can easily remove the pit by hand. Proceed to cut or simply tear the cherry in two.\nPlace all your cherries in a large mixing bowl as you go. When you're done pitting and splitting the cherries, add the sugar, lemon juice and zest. Mix well and let the cherries rest for several hours or, even better, overnight.After its rest, the cherries should have given off quite a bit of their own liquid.\nPlace the cherries and their liquid in a saucepan. Simmer, covered, for about 20-30 minutes, or until the cherries are quite soft and the liquid has thickened enough so a wooden spoon will leave an open trail behind it when you scrape it along the bottom of the saucepan. Fish out the lemon zest and let the cherries cool for a few minutes.\nNow you have different options depending on the texture you like best. To make a proper jam with a smooth texture, pass the cherries though a food mill. Or, if you're like me and like the chunkier texture of a preserve, use a hand blender and blend until you have a rough but fairly consistent paste. Or if you like it chunky, blend about half the cherries and leave the other half as is.\nLet the cherry preserves cool completely and transfer them to a jar or other container for safe keeping.",

    "ingredients": [
      "200g (2 cups) pastry or all-purpose flour",
      "150g (1-1/2 sticks) butter",

      "A pinch of salt",

      "Water, q.b."
    ],
    "instructions": "In a bowl (or stand mixer) mix together the flour, sugar and a pinch of salt. Then mix in the butter, using your hands or the paddle of your stand mixer, until well incorporated. The resulting mixture will look a bit like little pebbles. Then the egg yolk (if using) and enough cold water so that the mixture just forms a solid dough. Do not knead or overmix, which will make the dough tough. And you should do this all quite quickly, so that the butter does not start to soften too much.\nWrap the dough in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for 30 minutes or more, to let the dough rest and stiffen up again.\n(NB: While the dough is resting, you can make the frangipane base and slice your apples.)\nTake the dough out of the fridge, remove the plastic wrap, and roll it out with a rolling pin into a round that is at least an inch wider than the tart pan in which you intend to bake your crostata.\nUsing your rolling pin, roll up the dough and then unroll it over the tart pan, trying as best you can to center it well. Gently push the pastry into the bottom of the pan with your fingers. (If, as sometimes happens, your pastry doesn't quite reach the edge of the pan, you can always 'nudge' the pastry outwards to cover the edges of the pan.) Prick the pastry with a fork all over to prevent puffing while it bakes. Then trim off any excess pastry, using the edge of the tart pan as your guide. (NB: If you prefer, you can leave the excess on and fold them inward over the filling when the time comes.)\nIn a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar in a mixing bowl. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix them well until you have a smooth paste. You can use a wooden spoon to start and then, once the ingredients are mixed, switch to a whisk to smooth the mixture out. But you can do with in one go, in a fraction of the time and with little effort, using a KitchenAid or other stand mixer, with the whisk attachment.\nWhen your pastry shell is ready, take the frangipane and slather it out evenly over the bottom of the shell with a rubber spatula. This will act as a 'bed' for your apples and help anchor them in place.\nPeel, core and slice the apples into thin half-rounds. Then arrange them attractively in the tart pan. Push one side gently into the frangipane bed, then lay it on its side. Proceed with the next piece, slightly overlapping the proceeding one like roof tiles, continuing around in concentric circles until the entire shell is filled with a single layer of apples slices. Trim off any excess pastry\u2014or, if you prefer, you can fold the edges over the outside of the apples.\nNow you are ready to bake your tart: If you have one large enough, place the tart pan on a cookie sheet (this will catch any spillage from the tart, but is not 100% necessary.) Place the tart pan in the hot oven (200C, 400F) for about 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to a moderate oven (180C, 350F) and bake for another 10 minutes, then sprinkle the apples with ample sugar, and bake for another 10 minutes or more, or until the apples have nicely browned along their edges and are perfectly soft when pierced with a knife.\nRemove the tart from the oven, place it on a cooling rack and let it cool off in its pan.\nIf you like, you can finish off the tart with an apricot glaze. To make the glaze, take apricot preserves and force them through a fine sieve with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula\u2014this will smooth out the consistency, as preserves usually have little bits of fruit in them. Then take this pur\u00e9e and heat it gently in a small saucepan with a spoonful or two of sugar to taste, depending on how sweet the preserves are in the first place. Thin out the pur\u00e9e with some water, until you have reached a brushable consistency.\nOnce the tart has cooled, brush over the warm glaze evenly over the entire surface of the apples, but avoiding the pastry.\nNow you're done! Enjoy your crostata di mele either by itself\u2014it is perfectly delicious\u2014or, if you want to gild the lily, with some whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.",

If you don't have a proper double-boiler, you can make do by setting a round bowl inside a saucepan half-full with simmering water. Stir gently until the chocolate has just melted and is perfectly smooth. Turn the heat down to a minimum. (If you using a liqueur, add a splash to the pan first, let it heat up and then add the chocolate.)\nRemove the figs from the oven and dip them, one by one, in the melted chocolate. You can either cover them entirely or, if you're using larger figs with their stems still attached (see Notes), you can leave the stems uncovered. If you're au fait with chopsticks, they are ideal for the job. If using the ground hazelnuts, sprinkle them on top of the figs while the chocolate is still quite liquid.\nLet the chocolate-covered figs cool completely on a baking tray lined with wax paper, at least 1-2 hours, until the chocolate has solidified again. If you're using the powdered sugar, dust the figs just before serving.",

      "Strong espresso coffee",
      "Simple syrup made from boiling equal amounts of sugar and water together (see Notes)"
    ],
    "instructions": "First, find yourself a flat-bottomed container that can go into the freezer. Most traditional recipes call for using an ice cube tray\u2014but that was back in the days when ice cube trays were all made of stainless steel with removable dividers. Nowadays, a metal loaf pan will do the trick.\nNow make some very strong espresso coffee. If you are using an espresso machine, you can simply brew your coffee directly into the loaf pan.\nMake a few shots, at least one per person, or pot of espresso brewed in a 'moka'. Then mix in simple sugar syrup to taste\u2014I usually just add a bit at a time, tasting until I reach the desired degree of sweetness. Personally, I like my granita (as I like my coffee) semi-sweet, but you will need at least some sugar syrup, not just for taste but also because it produces a smoother, softer texture than plain coffee, which would simply turn to dark colored ice if frozen by itself. Let the coffee and syrup mixture cool completely, then place it in the freezer.\nAfter about 30-45 minutes, check on the granita. Depending on how much you are making, there may be little or no change the first time you check, but if you see bits of frozen crust forming, stir the mixture with a wooden spoon or spatula. Check in about 30 minutes later, by which time it is likely that things will have developed. Time to stir again.\nContinue stirring the mixture every 30 minutes or so, until the granita has formed a kind of 'slush'. You want the mixture to be fairly soft but not liquid. It will have a granular texture\u2014that is not a defect but, as mentioned above, a desired characteristic that sets granita apart from sorbetto. Total freezing time will depend on how much you are making and the size of the container; the deeper the liquid, the longer it will take for it to freeze. Count on about 1-1/2 to 2 hours if you are making more than one or two servings.\nServe as is or\u2014if you are feeling indulgent\u2014with a nice dollop of whipped cream.",

Lay a slice of fried eggplant on top. Sprinkle generously with the filling, then ladle of some of the chocolate sauce. Repeat with a second and, if you like, a third slice. Top the last slice with sauce and then more of the fruits and nuts mixture or, for a more uniform appearance, just the almonds or pinoli.\n[NB: In the alternative, you can also assemble this dish in a large baking dish by layering the eggplant slices in rows, as if you were making a savory parmigiana.]\nRest: Let your Chocolate Eggplant rest until it is fully cooled before serving.

Let the stands fall onto a serving plate or, if making individual servings, the dessert bowl. As you proceed, the stands will pile up and form a mound resembling a mountain.

    ],
    "instructions": "Add the grano cotto to a saucepan, along with the other indicated ingredients, over low heat. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture turns creamy and porridge-like, usually about 5-10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool completely.\nPour the ricotta into a large mixing bowl. Add the sugar and whisk vigorously until the sugar is well incorporated and the mixture is rather fluffy. Mix in the eggs as well, one by one. Now add the cooled grano cotto, folding it into the ricotta cream until well incorporated. Add the cinnamon, vanilla and a few drops of orange blossom water. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Add more orange blossom water if you want a more perfumed filling, taking note that its intensity will lessen in baking. If you have the time, let this mixture rest in the fridge overnight. If not, even a few hours will do it good.\nMix the flour and sugar together by pulsing in a food processor. Then add the lard or butter and pulse until you have a sand like texture. Then add the egg yolks and mix again until the dough forms a ball, adding a bit of water, spoonful by spoonful, if need be. Cover the dough ball with plastic wrap and place in the fridge to chill for at least 30 minutes or until needed.\nTake the dough out of the fridge. Take about 2/3 of the dough and roll it out into a round. To do this, I like to form the dough into a ball, flour it to avoid sticking, then beat it out flat with a rolling pin first, turning it around, then over, to get a fairly even round disk. Then I begin to actually roll it out flat. The round should be big enough, of course, to line the inside of your pie plate.\nRoll the round of dough up with your rolling pin, the roll it out on top of a pie plate, which you will have greased well with a knob of lard or butter. (See Notes below about pie plate sizes). Using your fingers, make sure that the crust adheres to the sides. Cut off any excess dough that is hanging over the sides. (NB: A classic pastiera does not have any trimming around the edges.)\nPour the filling into the pie plate, taking care not to fill the pastry shell to the very top, since the filling will swell during baking.\nRoll out the remaining 1/3 of the dough, then cut into strips. Lay the strips over the filling in a diamond-shaped (not square) lattice pattern. Press the strips gently into the shell and cut off any excess dough.\nPlace the pastiera in a moderate hot oven (190C/375F) for about an hour, until the filling is cooked through and the top has browned nicely. Check on it from time to time. If the pastiera is browning too quickly and looks like it might burn, you can cover it loosely with foil. If, on the other hand, an hour has passed and it's not a brown as you'd like, turn up the heat to 200C/400F and let it bake for another 15 minutes or so. (You can also run it under a broiler, but take care as the high-fat content in the pastry means it will burn easily if left unattended.)\nLet the pastiera cool completely. If you have the time, let it rest overnight. Serve, straight from the pie plate, dusted with confectioner's sugar.",

Knead briefly until the dough is soft and elastic. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, then in a towel, and let rest for a good 30 minutes or more. See notes below for using store-bought dough.\nWhile the dough is resting, peel, core and slice the apples as thinly as you can. Add the sugar, cinnamon and raisins, which you will have drained and squeezed dry, and the pine nuts or almonds.\nMix things all together, moistening the mixture if you like with a bit of the rum in which the raisins have been soaked. Set aside.\nSaut\u00e9 the breadcrumbs in the melted butter over very gentle heat until they are lightly browned. Be careful not to over-brown the crumbs.\nWhen the dough has rested at least a good 30 minutes, mold it into a flat, rectangular shape and place it on a well-floured cotton (not terry cloth!) dish towel or, even better, a linen baker's couche.\nRoll the dough out as thinly as you can manage into a large, rectangular shape.

      "Confettini or candied 'sprinkles'"
    ],
    "instructions": "You begin by making dough with the first six ingredients. This was traditionally done by making what the Italians call a fontana, or fountain of flour, in the middle of which you make a well for other ingredients, then slowly incorporating the flour into the well by hand as you beat the eggs and other liquid ingredients with a fork. These days, however, a stand mixer makes short work of this. Just put in your flour, then the other ingredients, and mix until you get a nice dough, just as if you were making pasta.\nOnce the ingredients have formed a smooth dough, form it into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap. Let the dough rest for a good 30 minutes or so.\nAfter the dough has rested, take a handful of it at a time and roll it into a ball. Then roll each ball out into a 'log' as if you were making gnocchi, pulling on the ends from time to time stretch it out thinner, until it's about the thickness of your little finger. (If you can manage it, that it. Otherwise as close to that as you can get). Then cut the logs into short lengths, again just like you are making gnocchi, only much smaller.\nPlace the little pieces on a floured towel as you work, making sure that they are all in a single layer so they don't stick. Just before proceeding to the next step, you grab the ends of the towel and swish the balls around to lightly flour them.\nHeat the oil in a large pan. You want lots of oil so the little balls can deep fry in it. When the oil is nice and hot, but not boiling, plunge the dough balls into the oil a handful at a time. The oil will immediately bubble up vigorously.\nFry the dough balls until they are lightly browned. Drain on paper towels while you proceed to the next step.\nNow, in an ample saut\u00e9 pan or saucier or wok large enough to hold all of the dough balls, gently heat the honey until it liquifies. Add the stuffoli, stir or toss them gently to coat. Allow the struffoli to soak up the honey for a few minutes. If using the candied fruit (see Notes below) you will want to add them at this point.\nRemove your struffoli from the pan with a slotted spoon and arrange them on a plate. It is common to arrange them in a ciambella or ring, but you can also simply pile them high into a little 'Mount Vesuvius'. Let me cool, then decorate with some more candied fruit if you like Then sprinkle your pile with the sprinkles.\nStuffoli can be eaten immediately, but improve with age.",

      "5 eggs, separated",
      "About 250g (1/2 lb.) sugar",
      "Marsala",
      "Powdered cocoa"
    ],
    "instructions": "Begin by making some strong shots of espresso coffee:\nIf you don't have an espresso maker, a potful of espresso made in a stovetop pot will do quite fine. Then mix your espresso with some of the simple syrup, if you have some on hand, or just a few spoonfuls of sugar, to taste. You can also use the coffee without sugar, as the mascarpone cream will add sweetness.\nTo make the mascarpone mixture, separate the yolks from the whites. Set the whites aside for the moment. Then whisk the yolks together with the sugar briskly until they form a kind of cream; you should be able to see 'ribbons' in the mixture as you whisk it. A stand mixer makes short work of this job.\nThen add the mascarpone and a dash of marsala, and continue whisking until you have a homogeneous cream mixture.\nNow, in a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks.\nFold the egg whites gently into the mascarpone mixture.\nNow that you have your coffee and mascarpone mixture ready, it is time to assemble the dish: take a ladyfinger, dip it on both sides in the espresso, very briefly, just to barely coat the outside. (Don't linger or your ladyfingers will soften to mush!) As you dip the ladyfingers, arrange them in a rectangular or square baking dish. Continue until you have covered the bottom of the dish with them. (NB: Depending on the size of your dish, you may need to lay them in different directions and/or break some of the ladyfingers into shorter lengths.)\nOnce you have your first layer of ladyfingers, spread some of the mascarpone mixture over them, enough to cover them entirely. Then lay another layer of ladyfingers on top of that.\nFinally, lay over another layer of the mascapone mixture.\nPut the dish into the fridge for at least an hour, better several hours or even overnight. The longer you let it sit, the more the mascarpone mixture will penetrate the ladyfingers and soften them up. It will also help the elements to form a more solid mass. A freshly made tiramis\u00f9 will be very creamy and rather loose when served, as pictured above, while a well-rested one will be more cake-like. Each version has its charms.\nIn any event, right before you're ready to serve, dust the top of your tiramis\u00f9 with unsweetened cocoa powder (the kind you would bake with). Use as much or as little as you like. Personally, I prefer just a light dusting.",

    "ingredients": [
      "75g (1/2 cup) unsweetened cocoa (or equivalent in chocolate, broken up)",
      "2-3 spoonfuls of sugar (optional)",
      "Milk, q.b.",
      "1 kilo (2 lbs.) sponge cake or pound cake (or ladyfingers)",
      "Alchermes or other liqueur(s), q.b. (see Notes)",
      "8 egg yolks",
      "150g (3/4 cups) sugar",
      "75g (1/2 cup) flour",
      "1 liter (4 cups) milk",
      "Grated zest of 1/2 a lemon!For the topping (optional):",
      "Berries",
      "Sour cherries (amarene)",
      "Sliced almonds"
    ],
    "instructions": "Step 1: Make the crema pasticcera: In a standing mixer bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until smooth and the mixture forms 'ribbons' as the whisk rotates. Then add the flour slowly, bit by bit, into the mixture until fully incorporated.\nMeanwhile, heat the milk over moderate heat until hot, almost but not quite at the boil\u2014you will see little bubbles just beginning to form around the edge of the pot. Take the milk off the heat and drizzle it, little by little, into the mixer bowl.\nNow pour the whole thing from the bowl into the pot and put it over very gentle heat, mixing continuously with a whisk or wooden spoon. After a while, it should begin to thicken. Keep stirring until the mixture thickens to the point where it coats a spoon nicely. Remove from the heat, stir in the grated lemon zest, and let the mixture cool.\nStep 2: Melt the chocolate: Add the cocoa to a small pot with the sugar. Over the moderate flame, add milk, bit by bit, until the mixture turns to a thick but pourable paste.\nStep 3: Mise en place: It is now time to arrange all the elements of the dish so you can assemble your dessert. Pour the crema pasticcera into two bowls, with a bit more in one of the bowls. In the bowl containing the lesser half of the crema, whisk in the chocolate paste until fully incorporated. In a small bowl, pour a good bit of your liqueur(s). Now take your sponge cake or pound cake and slice it into 1 cm (1/2 inch) slices. Now you are ready to put things all together. Prepare whatever topping you have it mind.\nStep 4: Assemble the dish: Take trifle bowl or other serving container large enough to hold all the ingredients and cover the bottom with a thin layer of the plain crema. Make a layer of cake slices, breaking them up as needed to make a complete layer, like so:\nNow drizzle over a bit of the liqueur. No need to drown it. In fact, it helps to use a pastry brush so the slices don't get too soaked. Then add a layer of the chocolate crema.\nRepeat making layers in this way until you have run out of ingredients or filled your bowl. End with a layer of the plain crema. Arrange your topping if you want one: sliced strawberries, as pictured above, or sliced almonds or sour cherries or other sorts of berries are all very nice.\nStep 5: Rest: Place the bowl in the fridge and let the zuppa inglese rest for a good few hours. Some recipes call for as little as an hour and as much as a whole day. To my mind, 2-3 hours is probably the minimum to allow the flavors to meld and the crema and cake layers to adhere properly. Like a tiramis\u00f9, the dish will change in texture the longer it rests, getting softer over time. It's a matter of taste, really, at what point it is at its best.\nStep 6: Serving: It is best not to serve this dish right out of the fridge. Take it about 30-60 minutes before you want to serve it, to let it return almost to room temperature so you can better appreciate its flavors.",

    "instructions": "Mix the dry ingredients in the bowl of a standing mixer, using the paddle. Then add the water in a drizzle until a very stick dough has formed. If the dough seems dry, then add a bit more, a spoonful at a time. Take the bowl from the mixer and cover it with a towel and/or a plate and leave it in a warm (but not hot) place over night. [NB: No worries if you don't have a standing mixer, you can just mix your dough in a normal bowl with a wooden spoon.]\nScrape the dough out of the bowl with a spatula or wooden spoon onto a lightly floured surface. Flour your hands and form the mass of dough into a ball without kneading. Gingerly lay the dough on a lightly floured tea towel, then fold the ends of the towel on top of the dough. Let the bread rise again until it roughly doubles in size, which can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours.\nAbout 30 minutes before the second rise is over, preheat your oven to 450F/230C. Put a 4-1/2 or 5-1/2 quart cast iron casserole (about 10\" in diameter) with its cover, in the oven to preheat along with the oven itself.\nNB: For the next step: Make sure you have heavy oven mitts (it'll be too hot for a towel) and proceed with care!\nTake the casserole out of the oven using your oven mitt and lay it on a heat-resistant surface. Remove the cover and lay it aside. Take the towel with the dough and quickly flip the dough into the casserole (it will go in 'upside down', which is fine). Shake the casserole, if need be, to center the dough and then quick re-cover it.\nPut the casserole back in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Then take it out of the oven and remove the cover. (The bread will be ever so slightly browned.)\nPut the casserole back into the oven, uncovered, and bake for another 15-20 minutes, until the bread has developed a beautiful golden brown crust. Turn the bread out onto a cooling rack and leave it until it has completely cooled.\nWhen the bread has cooled completely, after about 45 minutes to an hour, it is ready to enjoy!",

      "A splash of olive oil (about 4 Tbs)",

      "Olives",
      "Capers",
      "Mozzarella"
    ],
    "instructions": "To make the pizza dough, begin by mixing the yeast well into the warm water with sugar and letting it proof for 5 minutes or so.\nThen put the flour in the bowl of a standing mixer, turn the mixer on to a moderately slow speed with the dough paddle attached. Add the yeast mixture and then a splash of olive oil. When those have been incorporated, start adding tepid water until a dough is formed; the exact quantity is not really possible to say, because there are so many variables, including the weather! The dough you want will be quite elastic but quite soft, even somewhat 'wet'\u2014much more so than, say, pasta dough\u2014but it needs to be firm enough so you can work with it manageably.\nNow switch to the dough hook and knead the dough for a good 5 minutes or so. If you find that the dough is so wet it is not forming the proverbial 'ball', add more flour, bit by bit.\nAfter kneading, remove the dough from the bowl, plop it onto a lightly floured spianatoia or other surface, and knead it some more by hand, to make sure it has the right, springy consistency. Here's the test: if you stick your finger into it, the dough should spring back, leaving no trace of your finger.\n[In the alternative, if you don't have a mixer or just prefer to do it by hand, pile the flour on a surface, making a well in the middle of it (which is called a fontana or \"fountain\" in Italian). Add the yeast and oil into the middle and begin to incorporate flour by cupping your hands and drawing some of the flour from the sides into the 'fountain' and mixing. Add more water, a bit at a time, and incorporate more flour, until you have formed a dough, then knead by hand for a good 10-15 minutes.]\nTake your dough ball and let it rest in a deep bowl, covered with a cloth towel, for about 2 hours. (Lightly flouring or greasing the dough helps it to rise and prevents it from sticking to the sides of the bowl.) The dough should have risen quite a bit, doubling or even trebling in volume. The dough is now ready to use, although you can punch it down and let it rise a number of times if you like. The longer you let it rise, the tastier it will be. One of our favorite pizzerie in Rome, Dar Poeta in Trastevere, was famous for letting their doughs rise for 24 hours.\nTo assemble and bake the pizza: Oil a baking dish generously with olive oil. Place the dough in the dish and spread it out with your fingers so it covers the entire bottom of the pan. Cover again with a towel and allow the dough to rise once more for about an hour.\n\nAngelina's Pizza Casareccia\nNow top the dough with crushed tomatoes that you will have drained in a sieve to remove the excess liquid or whole canned tomatoes that you will have passed through a food mill. Spread the tomatoes across the top gently with a spoon or spatula, leaving a rather thin coating.\nYou can add whatever extra toppings that you like: anchovies (as pictured), capers, olives, etc.\nFinally, sprinkle the surface of the pizza with just a bit of oregano if you like (please, not too much, just a pinch) and drizzle generously with olive oil.\nBake in a hot (200C/400F) oven for about 30-45 minutes. The dough should puff up but don't allow the top to brown too much. To make sure it is cooked through, slip a small knife into it to see if it comes out clean and the dough feels 'dry'. If in doubt, you can try a piece\u2014the texture should be a bit chewy but not at all 'doughy'\u2014and put it back in the oven for a few more minutes. Allow the pizza to cool before eating; slightly warm or at room temperature, it's delicious!",

      "1 batch pizza dough, either store-bought or homemade",
      "1 head of escarole, saut\u00e9ed \"aglio e olio style\", with olive, capers, anchovies, pine nuts and raisins",

    "instructions": "Take half of the pizza dough and lay it out as flat as you can in a well-greased pie plate, making sure to cover the entire bottom and (if you can) the sides as well.\nSpoon the saut\u00e9ed escarole on top of the dough, making sure to leave a border of at least 3cm/1 in all around the edges.\nFlatten out the other half of the dough into a roughly round disk, and lay it over the escarole. With your fingers, attach the edges of the bottom and top rounds of dough, squeezing and twisting the dough to seal it well.\nOil the top of your 'pie' and prick it with a sharp knife to make some air holes.\nBake in a moderately hot oven (190C/375F) for a good 30-45 minutes, or until the top is nice and golden brown. Let the pizza cool before eating it; it taste best either slightly warm or room temperature. It tastes fine made ahead of time as well.",

    "instructions": "All you need to do is to take some pizza dough, either homemade or store-bought, and form it into balls about the size of a golfball. You then flatten each ball out into small round, leaving a slight lip around its edges\u2014or, as I mentioned in the post on calzoncini, you can use a tortilla press to do the job in much less time. In fact, I prefer the tortilla press as it will make the dough thinner than at least I can manage with my hands.\nAs you form each round, fry it in hot oil until it is lightly browned on both sides, preferably olive oil but if that's too rich for you, vegetable oil, or a combination of the two, will do fine. Don't brown the dough too much, as it will brown further in the oven later on.\nAs they are done, place them on a rack (or paper towels) to drain.\nNow it's time to get creative. You place these little fried pizza rounds on a cookie sheet and top them with whatever strikes your fancy\u2014basically anything you'd put on a pizza, you can put on a pizzetta. A fried pizza round can also be made in bianco (without tomato) with cheese or other toppings.\nOnce you've assembled your pizzette, drizzle them with a bit of olive oil and season with salt, then pop them in a hot oven (200C/400C) for about 5 minutes or so, just until they warmed through and the cheese (if any) has melted.",

    "ingredients": [
      "One batch of pizza dough, preferably homemade",
      "One can of anchovies in olive oil"
    ],
    "instructions": "Simply make a regular batch of pizza dough (see my post on Angelina's pizza casereccia for the recipe) or buy some pizza dough at your local Italian deli.\nGrabbing a walnut-sized ball of dough, make a well in the middle of the ball with your finger and place a single anchovy fillet inside. Then bring the sides around the fillet to cover the well and form a nice ball. You may need to roll the dough around in your hands a bit to make sure the opening is well sealed. Continue in the same fashion with the rest of the dough.\nNow fry them gently in olive oil, or a mix of olive and canola oil, until they are nice and golden brown on all sides. It will take no longer than five minutes or so. Regulate the temperature so they do not brown too quickly, before the insides have a chance to cook. They will swell up as they fry, which is exactly what you want. Drain them on paper towels or on a rack.\nZeppole are really best eaten right away, but you can keep them warm in a slow oven, on a baking rack placed over a cookie sheet, or even reheat them later. They will lose a bit of their crispiness but none of their goodness.",
